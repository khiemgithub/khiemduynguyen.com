                            <h2>Pinky Swear Android App</h2>
                            <h3>Let's Get Productive!</h3>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS%20intro%20picture.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4>Overview &amp; Goal</h4>
                            <p>Pinky Swear is an Android mobile application that strives to offer users a novel and fun way to stay productive. Initially developed as a side project, the primary idea was to allow a user (i.e. User A) make a "promise" to another randomly matched user (i.e. User B), who in turn will also have to make a promise to User A.</p> 
                            <p>A specific timeframe of 24 hours will be set for both users, and throughout the course, User A and B will have the chance to communicate with each another via a chat messenging tool - giving them a chance to encourage one another to fulfill his/her promise.</p>
                            <p>The catch? Once User A fulfills his/her promise in action, only User B can check it off on the app - thereby giving the app a collaborative nature overall. In a way, you can refer to Pinky Swear as a "collaborative to-do-list" app.</p>
                            <h4>User Research</h4>
                            <p>Quantitative user research was conducted in the form of a <b>Survey.</b> A total of 50 people were randomly chosen from friend and family circles, as well as the public. Below is a summary analysis of the process, along with important questions asked, associated responses, and data findings.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/ps-infographic.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>From the survey, <b>3 important numbers</b> that support the concept behind Pinky Swear receive the most attention:</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS%20research%20finding.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>From the indications above, <b>the last finding proves to be particularly important</b> as it revolves around a core feature of Pinky Swear - to make promises with one another and engage in a collaborative process in order to encourage each other's fulfillment of the respective promises - thereby illustrating a big opportunity.</p>
                            <p>Through the research, it is also interesting to find that our largest target audience consists of females aged between 18 and 49, and those who typically possess 1-4 actions they have to complete as well as be reminded of per day.</p>
                            <h4>Ideation/Sketches</h4>
                            <p>Early <b>Sketches</b> were followed after some brainstorming sessions.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS%20ideation2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4>User Flow/Wireframes</h4>
                            <p>Based on the user research, feedback, and early sketches - a high-fidelity <b>User Flow</b> and a set of <b>Wireframes</b> were created for <b>Usability Testing</b> purposes.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS%20user%20flow.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>The following are <b>important design decisions made:</b></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Provide "Sign Up With Facebook" as the only available registration option to speed up the onboarding process - making it the more easy and convenient for users to start using the app.</li>
                                <li>Provide 2 methods for creating promises:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Using "predefined promises" suggested by the app in order to get users started with Pinky Swear, while giving them a good idea of the promise types they could make.</li>
                                        <li>Customizing their own promises and essentially creating whatever the users wish.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Allow users to see the exact number of promises they've fulfilled ever since the app's initial download. This will serve as the motivational force.</li>
                                <li>Allow users to communicate with their matched partners via a chat messaging tool, in order to enhance the "fun" aspect. Once a promise is fulfilled in action, only the user's partner can check it off by tapping the "Fulfill" button.</li>
                                <li>Allow users to check the current progress of their promises, their matched partners' promises, and time left to fulfill the promises. At the same time, allow users to review past promises that either failed or were successfully fulfilled. These will serve as the "Overview" dashboards for users to get a good grasp of where they stand.</li>
                            </ul> 
                            <h4>Prototype/Usability Testing</h4>
                            <p>Using the wireframes above, an <b>Interactive Prototype</b> was created to test on 10 users. Their feedback was then incorporated into the next design iteration.</p>
                            <p><b>The following are key changes:</b></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>On the screen where users can see the exact number of promises they've fulfilled ever since the app's download, a small motivational message can accompany the number. Depending on the range within which the number is located, the message could be different. In this regards, the respective ranges would be:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>1 to 24</li>
                                        <li>25 to 49</li>
                                        <li>50 to 74</li>
                                        <li>75 to 100</li>
                                        <li>100+</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Allow users to add images and emoticons within the chat messaging tool. Images can help with the "evidence" factor, giving users a way to prove that they have indeed carried out an action and fulfilled their promises. Emoticons will help to make the chats more fun and inviting.</li>
                                <li>Include "Popular" as one of the promise categories. This will contain the most commonly used promises within the Pinky Swear community.</li>
                                <li>White background with soft flat colors on top to complement the clean and minimalist design concept.</li>
                                <li>Big, bold buttons and generally easily identifiable action items.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>High-Fidelity Designs - Final</h4>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS%20high%20fidel%203.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4>Releases</h4>
                            <p>After roughly 4 months of design, development, as well as marketing efforts, the 1st version of Pinky Swear was released onto Google Play in June 2015. While the initial plan was to only build the app for fun, opportunities where Pinky Swear's current as well as potential features could be further developed were explored.</p> 
                            <p><b>A 2nd round of usability testing</b> was conducted using the functional app (5 participants), and below are <b>key changes/additions:</b></p>          <ul>
                                <li>Implement a "match up with Facebook friends" feature. This will allow users who feel uncomfortable about being matched with strangers to find partners within their friend or family circles.</li>
                                <li>Implement a pop-up notification which says "Well done! You've just fulfilled a promise" after the user's partner checks off his/her promise. This can appear on any screens in the app, or even outside of the app.</li>
                                <li>Implement pop-up notifications that inform users of promise deadlines approaching, AND promises that have passed deadlines.</li>
                                <li>Implement a simple 1-page tutorial that will teach users how to use Pinky Swear. This screen will be automatically visible to newly registered users as soon as they log in for the first time.
                                    <ul>
                                	   <li>Implement a "Tutorial" button located next to the "Profile" button. This will allow users to access the Tutorial page at all time.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>                          
                            <p>Feedback from the usability test allowed us to release Pinky Swear V.2 in November 2015.</p>

                            <h4>Update</h4>
                            <p>As of March 2016, the decision had been made to discontinue Pinky Swear's operation, due to a lack of market interest. With well <b>over 500 downloads</b> throughout its lifetime, this concluded our one year of experience with this very special project - one that had taught us a great lesson about the end-to-end cycle of agile product development. More importantly, we've given ourselves the chance to appreciate the significance of teamwork and collaboration as a component of success.</p>
                            <p><b>With Pinky Swear, I've personally had the opportunity to ship my first ever design as a UX professional.</b> As such, the app will always maintain a very special spot in my heart. Thank you to everyone who has shown and continues to offer your support to Pinky Swear. This experience wouldn't have been possible without all of you. :)</p>

                            <h4>Overview</h4>
                            <p>Amazon Web Services Internet of Things (AWS IoT) is a managed cloud platform that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices. AWS IoT can support billions of devices and trillions of messages, and can process and route those messages to AWS endpoints and to other devices reliably and securely. With AWS IoT, applications can keep track of and communicate with all your devices, all the time, even when they aren’t connected. (Source: <a href="https://goo.gl/U6G0sQ">AWS IoT</a>)</p>
                            <p><b>In an initiative to improve usability for the AWS IoT Console, Amazon has partnered with our team to design and conduct a baseline usability study for the product. The goal? To better understand  the end-to-end process of how developers can set up a development environment in AWS IoT with various devices connected, and effectively transfer data between these devices and the environment itself.</b></p>
                            <p>Through close collaboration with the AWS IoT's User Research Team, <b>we had the opportunity to participate in every stage of the process’s timeline, which include:</b></p>

                            <h3>Bringing Students to Healthy Meals</h3>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum%20intro%20pic.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                            <p>Eating healthy is a challenge for a lot of students. For many, it is difficult to make time for nutritious meals in between classes and work. For others, a limited budget might be keeping them from actively choosing healthy food. This food culture enables a student body that prioritizes speed and convenience over health and food quality.</p>
                            <p>This project strives to gain a better understanding of the many barriers students face in making healthy food choices as they make their way around campus. Through various research methods, we want to learn the variety of behaviors that students exhibit towards healthy food options, and by doing so, our goal is <b>to design an engaging solution that will help students access healthier, more informed, and wholesome food within the UW vicinity.</b></p>
                            <h4>User Research</h4>
                            <p>Three primary research methods were utilized throughout the research process, including <b>Interviews, Surveys, and "Fly-On-The-Wall" Observations.</b></p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum%20user%20research.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>Affinity Diagram</b></p>
							<p>After reviewing all of our interview and observation notes, as well as the survey response summary, we got together and produced an Affinity Diagram as a group. Using sticky notes, each person posted on the board comments, patterns, and information we gathered from the researches. We then sorted them into groups based on intuitive relationships. This allowed us to come up with <b>five groups in accordance with these themes:</b></p>
							<ol>
								<li>Time</li>
								<li>Social</li>
								<li>Attitudes toward Food</li> 
								<li>Uncertainties</li>
								<li>Lifestyle</li>
							</ol>
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum%20affinity%20diagram.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>Summary of Findings</b></p>
							<p>Among all of our research findings, <b>we are particularly interested in the following:</b></p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum%20summary.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>User Characteristics/Design Question/Personas</b></p>
							<p>Based on the researching findings presented above, we were able to define the following User Characteristics:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Students who want to adopt healthier eating habits benefit from sharing peers’ experience.</li>
                                <li>Peer influence can be a great motivation for students.</li>
                                <li>Eating more healthily cannot compromise dynamic lifestyle and fast-paced schedule.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Within the context of these characteristics, we refined our Design Question, and accordingly came up with two primary Personas:</p>
                            <p><i>"How can we utilize <strong>PEER INFLUENCE</strong> to motivate UW students to eat more healthily while keeping up with a busy schedule?"</i></p>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum%20persona%202.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>User Design Requirements</b></p>
                            <p>Lastly, these User Design Requirements are solidified. Each requirement should appropriately correlate with one or more of the findings:</p>

							<h4>Sketches/Wireframes/Usability Testing</h4>
							<p><b>Sketches</b></p>
							<p>Early, quick and dirty Sketches were made to document, organize, and filter interesting ideas.</p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum%20sketch%201.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>Wireframes</b></p>
							<p>These early sketches were then transformed into a set of Wireframes with specific desired features. Below is a selected sample:</p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum%20alpha.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>Usability Testing</b></p>
							<p>Using the <b>"Think-Aloud Protocol" Method</b>, a usability test was conducted with a total number of 7 UW students. The test focused on the user’s ability to search, post and utilize other product features. Usability test tasks were designed to assess the accessibility and understandability of the end-to-end user flow for the app's major features.</p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/user%20test%202.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p>Participants of the usability test were both UW undergraduate and graduate students interested in healthy eating on and around campus.</p>
							<p>Concept-wise, the test revealed users' desire to see a focus on not only homemade meals/recipes, but also meals that they may discover from eating out at restaurants, bistros, cafes etc. In this regards, <b>the ability to find, discover, and share healthy "menu items" was an important addition of which the usability test has provided.</b></p>
							<p>On the other hand, below is a list of <b>other key findings and changes made:</b></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>ISSUE:</b> Users are confused about the process of sharing a new homemade recipe.</li>

                                    <li>Implement a vivid "Post" button on the "Trending" page.</li>
                                    <li>Remove the ability to share and ask about existing recipes.</li>
                                    <li>Allow users to access the "Search" and "Post" features from the burger menu.</li>
                                    <li>Develop the burger menu to include all of these options: My Profile, Search Recipes, Search Menu Items, Post Recipes, and Post Menu Items.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li><b>ISSUE:</b> Users can't locate the "Search" feature to filter and find recipes.</li>
                                <p><b>SOLUTIONS</b></p>

                                <li><b>ISSUE:</b> Users don't quite understand what the "Trending" page means (where the top meals as rated by the Husky Yum community are listed).</li>
                                <p><b>SOLUTIONS</b></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Redesign the "Trending" page's user interface to make it more visual with less text.</li>
                                    <li>Include a photo of the homademade recipe or menu item in question.</li>
                                    <li>Present only the top 5 homademade recipes or menu items as rated by the HuskyYum community.</li>
                                    <li>Allow users to easily navigage through the top 5 homemade recipes or menu items by swiping right or left.</li>
                                    <li>Implement two tabs close to the top of the screen, "Homemade" and "Eat-out", so users can conveniently view either the top 5 homemade recipes or menu items.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li><b>ISSUE:</b> The "Add to Shopping List" feature - where users can add a specific recipe's ingredients to a personal shopping list for review - is only visible after some deep scrolling.</li>

                            </ol>
							<h4><b>High-Fidelity Designs</b></h4>
							<p> The collected data from the usability test allowed us to make significant changes to our wireframes, which are then transformed into High-Fidelity Designs with a proper color palette and iconography usage.</p>
                            <p>Below is an interactive prototype that delineates the user onboarding process, as well as one of the primary workflows which Husky Yum strives to offer: <b>Searching For a Healthy Homemade Recipe</b>. Simply follow these steps:</p>
                            <iframe src="https://marvelapp.com/131ga8d?emb=1" width="289" height="593" style="float:right" allowTransparency="true" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Tap on "Sign Up".</li>
                                <li>Mentally fill in the text fields. Tap on "Next".</li>
                                <li>Mentally turn on/off diet filters. Tap on "Submit".</li>
                                <li>Swipe-Left to check 2nd Recipe in the "Top 5 Recipes" list (simply click on the right side of the screen).</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Search" icon.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Add Ingredient" sign. Repeat this step twice. Make sure to always tap on the sign next to a blank field.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Search".</li>
                                <li>Tap on the "Veggie Fried Rice" box.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Save" to save "Veggie Fried Rice" from its profile.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Find saved recipes via these steps:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Tap on "Burger Menu" icon.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Profile" box.</li>

                            </ol>
                            <p>With a significant number of users expressing a desire to see a similar process for <b>Healthy Menu Items</b> found outside of the home kitchen, here's a another quick interactive prototype which effectively illustrates this flow:</p>
                            <iframe src="https://marvelapp.com/1i9i2ha?emb=1" width="241" height="494" style="float:right" allowTransparency="true" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Tap on "Eat-out".</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Search" icon.</li>
                                <li>Mentally fill in all the fields.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Search".</li>
                                <li>Tap on the "Crab Fried Rice" box.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Save" to save "Crab Fried Rice" from its profile.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Burger Menu" icon.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Profile" box.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Saved Recipes &amp; Menu Items".</li>

                            </ol>
                            <p>One last important scenario that is equally important to the Husky Yum design concept is the creation of new recipes and/or menu items to be shared on the app. Here, we follow the steps for <b>Posting a New Healthy Homemade Recipe</b> as an example:
                            <iframe src="https://marvelapp.com/5fbicag?emb=1" width="241" height="494" style="float:right" allowTransparency="true" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Tap on "Add/Post" icon.</li>
                                <li>Mentally fill in all the fields. Tap on "Instructions" box to edit.</li>
                                <li>Mentally fill in "Step 1" field. Tap on "Add Step 2". Mentally fill in "Step 2" field. Tap on "Add Step 3". Mentally fill in "Step 3" field. Tap on "Complete".</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Post".</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Burger Menu" icon.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Profile" box.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Posted Recipes &amp; Menu Items".</li>
                            </ol>
							<h4>Future Directions</h4>
							<p>As part of our <b>HCDE 518 class</b>, we had the chance to present Husky Yum to our instructors and peers at the end of the quarter. In this respect, the feedback provided to us were definitely very valuable. As such, they will continue to serve as an important lesson throughout our career.</p>
							<p><b>If I ever plan to continue with this project, nonetheless, here are a few things which I would like to work on next:</b></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Continue to conduct more user research and usability testing to discover design opportunities as well as test existing features.</li>
								<li>Explore different models and systems for the "Rating" feature.</li>
								<li>Explore different models and systems for the "Badge" feature.</li>
								<li>Explore more interaction/transition design ideas.</li>
								<li>Further develop the "Recipe and/or Menu Item Posting" experience.</li>
							</ul>

                            <h4>Overview</h4>
                            <p>Joomla! is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) for publishing web content. It is built on a model–view–controller web application framework that can be used independently of the CMS.</p>
                            <p><b>As part of the product development roadmap, the Production Leadership Team has decided to execute a complete redesign project for the next version of the system, Joomla 3.5 (web &amp; mobile).</b></p>
                            <p>Volunteers around the world were recruited for this project, and I was very fortunate to have obtained the role of UX Designer/Developer - <b> responsible for driving the end-to-end UX Design process, from user research, low-fidelity wireframing, usability testing, to eventual high-fidelity graphic design.</b></p>
                            <p>At the same time, I was given the formidable opportunity to <b>collaborate with other teams on redesigning/developing the two most visited Joomla domains - Joomla.org and Joomla.com - in an initiative to improve user sign up rates and branding.</b></p>
                            <h4>Design Samples</h4>
                            <p>Below is a slideshow of some design samples created for <b>Joomla.org.</b> Press the "Play" button, and simply click on the right-most area of the screen to see the next design. Click on the left-most area of the screen to revisit the previous design. Note that this is not an interactive prototype.</p>

                        	<h4>Still Curious?</h4>
                        	<p>In March 2016, I left the Joomla project to pursue other academic/professional goals. Nonetheless, the lessons I've learnt from this experience will always be irreplaceable as I continue to advance on in my UX career. At the same time, the opportunity to have met and befriended some of the most wonderful and talented people around the world was truly an amazing gift.</p>

                            <h3>A Smarter Way To Drive</h3>

                            <h4>Project Overview</h4>
                            <p>In May 2016, I had the chance to attend a UX Design workshop which focuses on the topic of "Aligning Organizational Vision With Product Design". Essentially, the objective of the workshop is to train designers in the art of designing better products while simultaneously &amp; fully optimizing the organizational vision as a solid foundation to base of their design decisions.</p>
                            <p>As part of the final project, we were asked to conduct two exercises. First, a <b>Comparative Analysis</b> between two products that operate within the same space and yet possess different design rationale due to the differing visions behind their production. Second, a <b>"Design Reimagination"</b> in which we were to pick one product between the two and take it through a quick design process in order to uncover a small sample of usability issues, and accordingly to produce a set of redesign ideas to solve these issues.</p>
                            <h4>Part 1 - Comparative Analysis</h4>
                            <p><b>For my Comparative Analysis, I've picked two mobile applications that operate within the Traffic Navigation industry, Google Maps &amp; INRIX Traffic.</b> The choice was mostly a personal preference. I've always been a big fan of cars &amp; automobiles, and recently I've discovered an interest for Big Data &amp; Machine Learning. Combining these components together - along with my passion for UX Design - and the decision to challenge myself with these two apps is almost a no-brainer.</p>

                            <p>Note that for the purposes of this project, only the <b>ANDROID</b> version of both apps are used.</p>

                            <p><b>Google Maps VS. INRIX Traffic</b></p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/inrixlogo.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Most of us are fairly familiar with Google Maps. It is a global web mapping service developed by Google which offers satellite imagery, street maps, 360 degrees paranomic view, real-time traffic conditions, and route planning for travelling by foot, car, bicycle, or public transportation. Google Maps, in essence, is a one-stop-shop for all things physical navigation &amp; positioning, and is available on both web &amp; mobile platforms - the latter of which is chosen for the purpose of this project's analysis.</p>
                            <p>INRIX Traffic is a mobile application developed by INRIX, a global company which provides a variety of services pertaining to road traffic &amp; driver services. In a nutshell, INRIX provides historical, real-time traffic information, traffic forecasts, travel times, travel time polygons and traffic count to businesses &amp; individuals. It also gathers, curates and reports roadway incidents such as traffic collisions, road closures and road works. Specifically within the context of INRIX Traffic, the app optimizes traffic &amp; GPS data from a global network of over 250 million connected vehicles, roadways and cities to improve users' commute by providing the best routes &amp; directions to new &amp; familiar destinations.</p> 
                            <p>Below is a small Comparative Analysis table that illustrates from a high-level perspective the feature offerings shared (or not) by Google Maps &amp; INRIX Traffic.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/inrixcompare.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>From the first glance, INRIX Traffic may present itself as being inferior to the giant that is Google Maps. However, a deep dig into the differing vision that lies behind these two products will help to explain the scope &amp; breadth of each app as a player within the Traffic Navigation industry, and accordingly their unique value propositions.</p>
                            <p>In this respect, while Google Map strives to offer users an integrated toolset of general mapping services that can provide them access to an enormous set of data regarding the geographic layout of the world - from traffic information to your local sushi restaurant - INRIX strictly focuses on the realm of traffic intelligence &amp; management.</p>
                            <p>As one large corporation, Google's mission is to organize all the world's information into a single platform. As a member of this big family, Google Maps' goal is to take the world's physical information and make it accessible and useful to everyone. On the other hand, INRIX's mission for INRIX Traffic is a lot simpler and perfectly focused. In the words Bryan Mystele, President &amp; CEO of INRIX:</p> 
                            <p><b><i>"We designed INRIX Traffic with one specific vision: To help drivers move through their daily lives as quickly and efficiently as possible".</i></b></p>
                            <p><b>Design Rationale</b></p>
                            <p>With this understanding of the two apps' individual market position, the next step in the process is to analyze the differences that exist between their designs. Remember that while the aim of Google Maps is to provide users an end-to-end physical information-accessing platform, INRIX Traffic's primary objective is to offer drivers (and specifically drivers only) a tool that can help them make better driving decisions with the help of real-time traffic information.</p>
                            <p>As such, since INRIX Traffic is very specifically catered to drivers - who most likely would find themselves in need of the app while on the road, given the constantly changing traffic conditions in metropolitan cities - the app should be optimally designed so that it is quick &amp; easy to use. Furthermore, this quick &amp; easy characteristic should also be prioritized under the objective of helping drivers focus on the road rather than their phone screens. Number of steps to complete a task should be kept to the minimum, and design components should be as intuitive &amp; efficient as possible.</p>
                            <p>In this respect, I've picked out two specific design components which - in my belief - speak up largely to this "quick &amp; easy" principle that defines the INRIX Traffic experience.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The Zoom-In &amp; Zoom-Out Buttons</li>
                                <li>The Voice-Assistant Activation/Deactivation Toggle</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p><b>Zoom-In &amp; Zoom-Out</b></p>
                            <p>Users have various reasons why they may want to zoom-in or zoom-out of the map. Frequently, they might have to do this while driving. With Google Maps, users will have to directly interact with the screen via their hand gestures to accomplish this task. With INRIX Traffic, the two "Add" &amp; "Minus" buttons have made this a much simpler action.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/inrix1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p><b>Activate/Deactivate Voice Assistant</b></p>
                            <p>The Voice Assistant is a central component to any GPS tool. Both Google Maps &amp; INRIX Traffic effectively employ this feature. However, for different reasons, having a Voice Assistant isn't something that is always desired, and of course, turning the Voice Assistant off (or on again) is plausible with both apps. With INRIX Traffic, it is an easy toggle switch. With Google Maps, on the other hand, the presence of an extra feature has created an additional step in this process for users.</p>

                            <h4>Part 2 - Reimagining INRIX Traffic</h4>
                            <p>For the second part of this project, the goal is to <b>take the current INRIX Traffic App through a short design process in order to uncover certain usability issues, as well as come up with potential solution suggestions.</b> In this respect, the process is as follows:</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/inrix4.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/inrix5.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/inrix6.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p><b>Summary of Usability Issues &amp; Proposed Solutions</b></p>
                            <p>Through a combination of Heuristic Analysis &amp; Usability Interviews (Test), these are revealed to be <b>the most important issues:</b></p>
                            <p><b>ISSUE 1:</b> Ineffective Feedback After Adding A New Trip</p>
                            <p><b>Screen:</b> TRIPS</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/inrix7.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p><b>Suggestion:</b> After the new trip is added, the calendar should jump to the corresponding date on which this trip was set up for.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/inrix10.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p><b>ISSUE 2:</b> Navigation Settings Not Available For Individual Route</p>
                            <p><b>Screen:</b> MAP</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/inrix9.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/inrix9.5.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p><b>Suggestion:</b> Allow users to apply Navigation Settings for each specific route. Implement a "Filter" button that is always accessible on the map so users can change their Navigation Settings wherever &amp; whenever.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/inrixnew2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p><b>ISSUE 3:</b> Heavy Information &amp; Unclean Layout On "Places" Screen</p>
                            <p><b>Screen:</b> PLACES</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/inrix8.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p><b>Suggestion:</b> Consider hiding traffic information under its corresponding place using the "Pop-Up, Pop-Down" functionality (i.e. if a user wants to see traffic information for Bellevue College, he/she can tap on Kirkland Library and open a pop-up box which contains the relevant data, and accordingly tap anywhere to close the pop-up).</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/inrixnew1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4>Other Suggestions</h4>
                            <p>Lastly, a number of minor suggestions that can be optimized to improve the overall Traffic App experience.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Consider exploring other icon designs for "Compass" &amp; "Route" on the "Map" screen which are more intuitive to users - thereby <b>improving usage recognition.</b></li>
                                <li>When adding a new place on the "Places" screen, consider exploring another icon design for "Other" that are more intuitive to users than "Star". Again, <b>usage recognition is potentially enhanced.</b></li>
                                <li>Consider redesigning the "Line Bars" which represent the traffic condition of potential routes to take. Many participants from the interview have expressed that the current design may seem a bit old-fashioned &amp; unclean. Material Design could be explored for its <b>minimalist &amp; clean concept</b>.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Designing For The Global Audience</h3>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/vnintro.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                            <h4>Overview</h4>
                            <p>With Vietnam becoming increasingly economically &amp; politically integrated with the world, VnExpress (known to be the most popular E-Newspaper in Vietnam) sees a great opportunity &amp; need to extend its reach to a growing portion of global readers who share a mutual interest in the country's affairs. <b>This ultimately lead to the executive decision to design &amp; build Vietnam International - the English Version of VnExpress - with the hope of bringing more Vietnamese as well as ASEAN news to the world.</b></p>
                            
                            <p><b>I was very fortunate to have obtained the opportunity to connect &amp; collaborate with the VnExpress Design Team for this project - in the role of a Web Designer/Developer (responsible for all aspects of the research &amp; design process).</b> Beginning in late 2015, we were finally able to launch the full website (web &amp; mobile) for VnExpress International to our global readers in April 2016.</p>

                            <p>From a personal perspective, this project has offered me a truly educational experience. Besides the enriching learnings I had within the realm of Responsive Web Design, the chance to build the international version of an E-News platform has taught me the mechanism of Localization and its significant role in product design as the world we live in becomes the more globalized.</p>

                            <h4>Final Designs</h4>
                            <p>Due to the project's strict NDA, I won't be able to showcase many of the design assets and/or data created throughout the project's timeline. Nonetheless, below is one particular example of an important design decision made regarding the <b>Content Positioning</b> of VnExpress and its international counterpart. While most of the important design differences revolve around the Information Architecture &amp; Content Strategy between the two versions, this feature has emerged as the most interesting component to me.</p>
                            <p><b>VIETNAMESE</b></p>
                            <p>From our user research (primarily through <b>Eye-Tracking/Heat Map Analysis</b> methods), it was revealed that a lot of Vietnamese readers have the tendency to view VnExpress's content via the <b>F-Shaped Pattern</b> - a concept that was first explored by UX expert Jakob Nielsen, who has conducted numerous tests on the ways users read web content. Essentially:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Users first read in a horizontal movement, usually across the upper part of the content area. This initial element forms the F's top bar.</li>
                                <li>Next, users move down the page a bit and then read across in a second horizontal movement that typically covers a shorter area than the previous movement. This additional element forms the F's lower bar.</li>
                                <li>Finally, users scan the content's left side in a vertical movement. Sometimes this is a fairly slow and systematic scan that appears as a solid stripe on an eyetracking heatmap. Other times users move faster, creating a spottier heatmap. This last element forms the F's stem.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><i>(From <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/">"F-Shaped Pattern For Reading Web Content"</a> by Jakob Nielsen)</i></p>
                            <p>As such, our research data has shown that Vietnamese users like to see content blocks listed in a vertical manner, in which they can quickly scroll through the site and browse for their preferred content. This is evident in both the Home Page &amp; Article Page of the Vietnamese site.</p>

                            <p><b>INTERNATIONAL</b></p>
                            <p>On the other hand, international readers have illustrated a mixed approach to viewing web content. While some follow the aforementioned F-Shaped Pattern, a significantly large portion of others have delineated a pattern that's more <b>"Z-Shaped"</b> in nature. In essence, users' content-viewing behavior is still naturally fast, in which they would typically begin by skimming quickly horizontally across the page. Nonetheless, rather than immediately moving on to scanning the content in a vertical movement, there's a tendency to prolong the original horizontal approach in an attempt to seek out for more interesting articles.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly, a design decision has been made to implement a hybrid pattern where components of both the F-Shape &amp; Z-Shape frameworks are optimized for VnExpress International. As one can see, content blocks are positioned in such a way that will allow for both effective vertical &amp; horizontal viewing.</p>

                            <p>Interestingly, mobile users have illustrated a consistent behavior amongst both Vietnamese and English readers. As shown below, this has influenced the general design for both versions of VnExpress to be relatively similar. The only key differences are only present to the extent of ensuring a sense of visual consistency between the web &amp; mobile versions of the two sites, as well as the relevant information architecture/content strategy.</p>
