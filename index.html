                            <h3>Let's Get Productive!</h3>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS intro picture.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4>Overview & Goal</h4>
                            <p>Pinky Swear is an Android mobile application that strives to offer users a novel & fun way to stay productive. Initially developed as a side project, the primary idea was to allow a user (i.e. User A) make a "promise" to another randomly matched user (i.e. User B), who in turn will also have to make a promise to User A.</p> 

                            <p>A specific timeframe of 24 hours will be set for both users, and throughout the course, User A and B will have the chance to communicate with each another via a chat messenging tool - giving them a chance to encourage one another to fulfill his/her promise.</p>

                            <p>The catch? Once User A fulfills his/her promise in action, only User B can check it off on the app - thereby giving the app a collaborative nature overall. In a way, you can refer to Pinky Swear as a "collaborative to-do-list" app.</p>

                            <h4>Design Process</h4>
                         	<img src="img/portfolio/PS process.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <h4>User Research</h4>
                            <p>Quantitative user research was conducted in the form of a <b>Survey.</b> A total of 50 people were randomly chosen from friend and family circles, as well as the public. Below is a summary analysis of the process, along with important questions asked, associated responses, and data findings.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS infographic.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>From the survey, <b>3 important indications</b> that support the concept behind Pinky Swear were solidified:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The market for "to-do-list" apps proves to be promising, with 75% of respondents already using an app of this kind.</li>

                                <li>A clear majority (85%) stated that they would consider a new app alternative, providing a definite cue to enter the market.</li>

                                <li><b>More than half of the respondents (56%) said that they would try-out the idea of "having another person act as a pushing force behind the completion process of their personal to do lists".</b> This last finding proves to be particularly important as it revolves around a core feature of Pinky Swear - to make promises with one another and engage in a collaborative process in order to encourage each other's fulfillment of the respective promises - thereby illustrating a big opportunity.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Through the research findings, it is also interesting to find that our largest target audience consists of females aged between 18 and 49, and those who typically possess 1-4 actions they have to complete as well as be reminded of per day.</p>

                            <h4>Ideation/Sketches</h4>
                            <p>Early <b>Sketches</b> and a <b>User Flow Draft</b> were followed after some brainstorming sessions.</p>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS ideation3.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <h4>User Flow/Wireframes</h4>
                            <p>Based on the user research, feedback, and early sketches - a high-fidelity <b>User Flow</b> and a set of <b>Wireframes</b> were created for <b>Usability Testing</b> purposes.</p>

                            <h4>Current Progress/Update</h4>
                            <p>After roughly 4 months of design & development, the 1st version of Pinky Swear was released onto Google Play in June 2015. While the initial plan was to only build the app for fun, opportunities where Pinky Swear's current as well as potential features could be further developed were explored.</p> 
                            <p>A 2nd round of usability testing was conducted using the functional app (5 participants), and below are <b>key changes/additions:</b></p>                          
                            <ul>
                                <li>Implement a "match up with Facebook friends" feature. This will allow users who feel uncomfortable about being matched with strangers to find partners within their friend or family circles.</li>
                                <li>Implement a pop-up notification which says "Well done! You've just fulfilled a promise" after the user's partner checks off his/her promise. This can appear on any screens in the app, or even outside of the app.</li>
                                <li>Implement pop-up notifications that inform users of promise deadlines approaching, AND promises that have passed deadlines.</li>
                                <li>Implement a simple 1-page tutorial that will teach users how to use Pinky Swear. This screen will be automatically visible to newly registered users as soon as they log in for the first time.</li>
                                <ul>
                                	<li>Implement a "Tutorial" button located next to the "Profile" button. This will allow users to access the Tutorial page at all time.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </ul>                          
                            <p style="margin-bottom:35px;">Pinky Swear is currently in the redesign process and have since been taken off Google Play. As soon as the 2nd version is ready for release, rest assured that you will be updated. Stay tuned!</p>

                            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                            <p>Many people today find themselves with amazing tech ideas and all the motivation required to transform these ideas into meaningful products/applications, and yet they typically experience difficulties getting started. Why?</p>
                            <p>This occurence is normally due to such individuals' lack of certain skill sets or field knowledge (i.e. they can code but they cannot design). At the same time, many talented professionals may want to contribute their skills to tech-oriented projects that are interesting or meaningful to them, and yet they often find it challenging to discover these ideas as well as those who own them.</p>

                            <h4>Competitive/Comparative Analysis</h4>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/collab competitive analysis.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>There exists a good number of websites today that specifically serve to connect individuals/organizations with freelancers who may be needed for certain projects. These resources, however, are typically designed as marketplaces rather than social networks. Hence, the majority of projects sourced via these sites are likely to be contract-based. Clients will simply aim to hire additional employees to get a job done. In turn, this approach limits the opportunity for passionate individuals who share a common interest to meet & collaborate.</p>
                            <p>Illustrated above are 5 popular "freelance marketplaces" commonly used by organizations & professionals today.</p>

                            <h4>User Research - Phase 1</h4>
                            <p>To offer a response to this market gap, <b>Collab wants to provide a tool which can:</b></p> 
                            <img src="img/portfolio/collab features.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            
                            <p>The ultimate objective? <b>To build an application where projects/ideas receive the main spotlight, while owners & collaborators have a place where they can connect, collaborate, and build products that can change the world.</b></p>
                            <p>To better understand the target audience, a few <b>Assumptions</b> were asked, mainly:</p>
                            <ul>
                            	<li><b>WHO</b> are the potential users?</li>
                            	<li><b>WHAT</b> do they want to accomplish?</li>
                            	<li><b>WHERE</b> do they wish to accomplish these tasks?</li>
                            	<li><b>WHY</b> do they want to accomplish these tasks?</li>
                            	<li><b>WHEN</b> do they want to accomplish these tasks?</li>

                            <p>And to better understand the users' needs & challenges, qualitative 1-hour long <b>Interviews</b> were conducted with 5 interviewees. Below is a list of questions asked, and a brief insight into the interviewees' profiles:</p>

                            <p>Based on the interview results, the following documents were created as stepping stones to the visualization of potential features/experience designs for Collab.</p>

                             <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                            <p>It is common for consumers to buy a lot of food without checking the expiration date on each particular item, and end up disposing a big chunk few days later. Such a habit can lead to frustrations, and subsequently a lot of money wasted on spoiled food that can't be used or eaten.</p>
                            <p>At the same time, for those who spend a lot of time grocery shopping & cooking, buying too much can make food management a difficult task. Food items getting spoiled is typically the result of their owners completely forgetting about them.</p>
                           
                            <h4>Competitive/Comparative Analysis</h4>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/foodtrack competitive analysis.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>A simple search for "food expiration date tracker app" on Google Play will return with more than dozens of apps that strive to fulfill this purpose. Nonetheless, a quick analysis will show that rarely do these apps end up in the "popular" group.</p>
                            <p>While the majority of food tracker apps commonly share 1 basic feature - allowing users to add/remove/edit food items manually, a small number of tech-savvier apps has introduced the barcode scanning feature, which allow users to scan food items in real-time and check their expiration dates on-demand. Although this is an innovative feature, even these apps are facing challenges with user attraction and/or even retention.</p>
                            <p>What, then, is the issue?</p>

                            <h4>User Research - Phase 1</h4>
                            <p>The goals behind FoodTrack are simple - <b>to seek an answer to the above question, and in turn, to re-imagine the ultimate Food Tracker App.</b></p>
                            <p>With FoodTrack, users will find <b>2 primary features - and accordingly their purposes - at its core:</b></p>

                            <p><b>Assumptions</b> were made to better understand the target audience, as well as to reaffirm the market need. In the form of questions, these include:</p>
                            <ul>
                            	<li><b>WHO</b> are the potential users?</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>A quantitative <b>Survey</b> was then conducted within a group of 50 users - out of whom 10 were selected for an <b>Interview</b> which focuses on the question:</p>

                            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                            <p>Eating healthy is a challenge for a lot of students. For many, it is difficult to make time for nutritious meals in between classes and work. For others, a limited budget might be keeping them from actively choosing healthy food. This food culture enables a student body that prioritizes speed and convenience over health and food quality.</p>
                            <p>This project strives to gain a better understanding of the many barriers students face in making healthy food choices as they make their way around campus. Through various research methods, we want to learn the variety of behaviors that students exhibit towards healthy food options, and by doing so, our goal is <b>to design an engaging solution that will help students access healthier, more informed, and wholesome food within the UW vicinity.</b></p>

                            <h4>User Research</h4>
                            <p>Three primary research methods were utilized throughout the research process, including <b>Interviews, Surveys, and "Fly-On-The-Wall" Observations.</b></p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum user research.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>Affinity Diagram</b></p>
							<p>After reviewing all of our interview and observation notes, as well as the survey response summary, we got together and produced an Affinity Diagram as a group. Using sticky notes, each person posted on the board comments, patterns, and information we gathered from the researches. We then sorted them into groups based on intuitive relationships. This allowed us to come up with five groups in accordance with these themes:</p>
							<b><ol>
								<li>Time</li>
								<li>Social</li>
								<li>Attitudes toward Food</li> 
								<li>Uncertainties</li>
								<li>Lifestyle</li>
							</ol></b>
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum affinity diagram.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>Summary of Findings</b></p>
							<p>Among all of our research findings, <b>we are particularly interested in the following:</b></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Our research shows that students lead a dynamic and fast-paced life, and are likely to be always on the go. Also, the survey results show that most students eat alone.</li>
								<li>Students who are already eating healthily are eager to share their knowledge and experience with others who are looking to adopt healthier eating habits.</li>
								<li>Students who want to adopt healthier eating habits benefit from sharing peers’ experience.</li>
								<li>Students who want to adopt healthier eating habits are interested in the eating lifestyle of individuals who are already eating healthily. For example, where they like to buy their food ingredients from.</li>
								<li>Students who want to adopt healthier eating habits are interested in the general knowledge base in regards to the variety of healthy meals cooked at home as well as the suitable ingredients used in order to prepare those meals.</li>
								<li>Students have their own specific requirements in respect to healthy meals their preparation. For example - How much time do they have to prepare the meal? What kind of cuisine are they in the mood for? Are they interested in cooking a vegetarian dish? etc. Actively, students are always on the hunt for healthy recipes that satisfy these specific requirements.</li>
								<li>Class schedule and time constraint are the main barriers to eating healthily.</li>     
							</ul>
							<p><b>User Design Requirements</b></p>
							<p>Based on the researching findings presented above, we came up with the following User Design Requirements. Each requirement should appropriately correlate with one or more of the findings:</p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum design requirements.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>User Characteristics/Design Question</b></p>
							<p>Accordingly, we were able to solidly define these User Characteristics:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Students who want to adopt healthier eating habits benefit from sharing peers’ experience.</li>
								<li>Peer influence can be a great motivation for students.</li>
								<li>Eating more healthily cannot compromise dynamic lifestyle and fast-paced schedule.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Which were then used to refine our principal Design Question:</p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum design question.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>Personas</b></p>
							<p>The following two Personas were produced in accordance with overall research findings:</p>

							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum persona 2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

							<p><b>User Flow</b></p>
							<p>Similarly, an extensive User Flow was created to envision a potential user experience for Husky Yum. Divided into two parts, the top chart illustrates the onboarding process, while the bottom chart delineates the rest.</p>

							<h4>Sketches/Wireframes/Usability Testing</h4>
							<p><b>Sketches</b></p>
							<p>Early, quick & dirty Sketches were made to document, organize, and filter interesting ideas.</p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum sketch 1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>Wireframes</b></p>
							<p>These early sketches were then transformed into a set of Wireframes with specific desired features.</p>

							<p><b>Usability Testing</b></p>
							<p>Using the <b>"Think-Aloud Protocol" Method</b>, a usability test was conducted with a total number of 7 UW students.The test focused on the user’s ability to search, post and utilize other product features. Usability test tasks were designed to assess the accessibility and understandability of the end-to-end user flow for the app's major features.</p>

							</p><img src="img/portfolio/user test 1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<img src="img/portfolio/user test 2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

							<p>Participants of the usability test were both UW undergraduate and graduate students interested in healthy eating on and around campus.</p>

							<p>Concept-wise, the test revealed users' desire to see a focus on not only homemade meals/recipes, but also meals that they may discover from eating out at restaurants, bistros, cafes etc. In this regards, <b>the ability to find, discover, and share healthy "menu items" was an important addition of which the usability test has provided.</b></p>

							<p>On the other hand, below is a list of <b>other key findings and changes made:</b></p>
