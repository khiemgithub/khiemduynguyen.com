                            <h4>Overview & Goal</h4>
                            <p>Pinky Swear is an Android mobile application that strives to offer users a novel & fun way to stay productive. Initially developed as a side project, the primary idea was to allow a user (i.e. User A) make a "promise" to another randomly matched user (i.e. User B), who in turn will also have to make a promise to User A.</p> 

                            <p>A specific timeframe of 24 hours will be set for both users, and throughout the course, User A and B will have the chance to communicate with each another via a chat messenging tool - giving them a chance to encourage one another to fulfill his/her promise.</p>

                            <p>The catch? Once User A fulfills his/her promise in action, only User B can check it off on the app - thereby giving the app a collaborative nature overall. In a way, you can refer to Pinky Swear as a "collaborative to-do-list" app.</p>

                            <h4>Design Process</h4>
                         	<img src="img/portfolio/PS process.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <h4>User Research</h4>
                            <p>Quantitative user research was conducted in the form of a <b>Survey.</b> A total of 50 people were randomly chosen from friend and family circles, as well as the public. Below is a summary analysis of the process, along with important questions asked, associated responses, and data findings.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS infographic.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>From the survey, <b>3 important numbers</b> that support the concept behind Pinky Swear receive the most attention:</p>

                            <p>From the indications above, <b>the last finding proves to be particularly important</b> as it revolves around a core feature of Pinky Swear - to make promises with one another and engage in a collaborative process in order to encourage each other's fulfillment of the respective promises - thereby illustrating a big opportunity.</p>
                            <p>Through the research, it is also interesting to find that our largest target audience consists of females aged between 18 and 49, and those who typically possess 1-4 actions they have to complete as well as be reminded of per day.</p>

                            <h4>Ideation/Sketches</h4>
                            <p>Early <b>Sketches</b> and a <b>User Flow Draft</b> were followed after some brainstorming sessions.</p>

                            <h4>Current Progress/Update</h4>
                            <p>After roughly 4 months of design & development, the 1st version of Pinky Swear was released onto Google Play in June 2015. While the initial plan was to only build the app for fun, opportunities where Pinky Swear's current as well as potential features could be further developed were explored.</p> 
                            <p><b>A 2nd round of usability testing</b> was conducted using the functional app (5 participants), and below are <b>key changes/additions:</b></p>                          
                            <ul>
                                <li>Implement a "match up with Facebook friends" feature. This will allow users who feel uncomfortable about being matched with strangers to find partners within their friend or family circles.</li>
                                <li>Implement a pop-up notification which says "Well done! You've just fulfilled a promise" after the user's partner checks off his/her promise. This can appear on any screens in the app, or even outside of the app.</li>
                                <li>Implement pop-up notifications that inform users of promise deadlines approaching, AND promises that have passed deadlines.</li>
                                <li>Implement a simple 1-page tutorial that will teach users how to use Pinky Swear. This screen will be automatically visible to newly registered users as soon as they log in for the first time.</li>
                                <ul>
                                	<li>Implement a "Tutorial" button located next to the "Profile" button. This will allow users to access the Tutorial page at all time.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </ul>                          
                            <p style="margin-bottom:35px;">Pinky Swear is currently in the redesign process (although you can still check out the 1st version here on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pinkyswear&hl=en">Google Play Store</a>). As soon as the 2nd version is ready for release, rest assured that you will be updated. Stay tuned!</p>

                            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                            <p>Many people today find themselves with amazing tech ideas and all the motivation required to transform these ideas into meaningful products/applications, and yet they typically experience difficulties getting started. Why?</p>
                            <p>This occurence is normally due to such individuals' lack of certain skill sets or field knowledge (i.e. they can code but they cannot design). At the same time, many talented professionals may want to contribute their skills to tech-oriented projects that are interesting or meaningful to them, and yet they often find it challenging to discover these ideas as well as those who own them.</p>

                            <h4>Competitive/Comparative Analysis</h4>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/collab competitive analysis.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>There exists a good number of websites today that specifically serve to connect individuals/organizations with freelancers who may be needed for certain projects. These resources, however, are typically designed as marketplaces rather than social networks. Hence, the majority of projects sourced via these sites are likely to be contract-based. Clients will simply aim to hire additional employees to get a job done. In turn, this approach limits the opportunity for passionate individuals who share a common interest to meet & collaborate.</p>
                            <p>Illustrated above are 5 popular "freelance marketplaces" commonly used by organizations & professionals today.</p>

                            <h4>User Research - Phase 1</h4>
                            <p>To offer a response to this market gap, <b>Collab wants to provide a tool which can:</b></p> 
                            <img src="img/portfolio/collab features.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            
                            <p>The ultimate objective? <b>To build an application where projects/ideas receive the main spotlight, while owners & collaborators have a place where they can connect, collaborate, and build products that can change the world.</b></p>
                            <p>To better understand the target audience, a few <b>Assumptions</b> were asked, mainly:</p>
                            <ul>
                            	<li><b>WHO</b> are the potential users?</li>
                            	<li><b>WHAT</b> do they want to accomplish?</li>
                            	<li><b>WHERE</b> do they wish to accomplish these tasks?</li>
                            	<li><b>WHY</b> do they want to accomplish these tasks?</li>
                            	<li><b>WHEN</b> do they want to accomplish these tasks?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/collab screening.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>And to better understand the users' needs & challenges, qualitative 1-hour long <b>Interviews</b> were conducted with 5 interviewees. Below is a list of questions asked, and a brief insight into the interviewees' profiles:</p>

                            <h4>Sketches/Wireframes</h4>
							<p>Based on overall research findings - early, quick & dirty <b>Sketches</b> were made to document, organize, and filter interesting ideas.</p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/collab sketch 1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">    
							<img src="img/portfolio/collab sketch 2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p>The best ideas were then iterated into clear <b>Wireframes</b> that come with a set of desired features.</p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/collab wireframes.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							
							<h4>Usability Testing</h4>
							<p>A <b>Usability Test</b> was conducted via the <b>"Think-Aloud Protocol" Method.</b> The primary goal was to elicit user feedback in order to help refine Collab's overall interaction as well as interface design. Usability test tasks were designed to assess the accessibility and understandability of the end-to-end user flow for the app's major features.</p>
							<p>A total of 5 users were recruited to help with the testing process. They were screened according to the following attributes:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Currently working or studying in any industries, areas, or disciplines related to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).</li>
								<li>At least an undergraduate college student.</li>
							</ol>
							<img src="img/portfolio/collab user test.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p>Following the test's conduction, <b>below is a list key findings recorded:</b></p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/collab findings 1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<img src="img/portfolio/collab findings 2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

							<h4>High-Fidelity Design</h4>
							<p>As the usability test has illustrated, <b>two new features</b> are to be implemented.</p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/collab new features.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p>The wireframes are then transformed into <b>High-Fidelity Designs</b> with a proper color palette and iconography usage.</p>

							<img src="img/portfolio/collab hi-fi design.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

							<h4>Update/Next Steps</h4>
							<p>In October 2015, I had the amazing opportunity to present Collab to a group of angel investors and entrepreneurs at the <b>Seattle Startup Week</b> event. Although I have no intention in pursuing the idea fully as a business, the feedback and advices given to me were more than invaluable.</p>
							<p><b>If I ever plan to continue with this project, nonetheless, here are a few things which I would like to work on next:</b></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Design the chat messaging experience.</li>
								<li>Conduct more user research & usability testing to further validate the idea, as well as testing on current features.</li>
								<li>Explore more interaction design ideas.</li>
								<li>Explore ways in which users can better discover each other as well as interesting projects.</li>
							</ul>

                             <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                            <p>It is common for consumers to buy a lot of food without checking the expiration date on each particular item, and end up disposing a big chunk few days later. Such a habit can lead to frustrations, and subsequently a lot of money wasted on spoiled food that can't be used or eaten.</p>
                            <p>At the same time, for those who spend a lot of time grocery shopping & cooking, buying too much can make food management a difficult task. Food items getting spoiled is typically the result of their owners completely forgetting about them.</p>
                           
                            <h4>Competitive/Comparative Analysis</h4>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/foodtrack competitive analysis.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>A simple search for "food expiration date tracker app" on Google Play will return with more than dozens of apps that strive to fulfill this purpose. Nonetheless, a quick analysis will show that rarely do these apps end up in the "popular" group.</p>
                            <p>While the majority of food tracker apps commonly share 1 basic feature - allowing users to add/remove/edit food items manually, a small number of tech-savvier apps has introduced the barcode scanning feature, which allow users to scan food items in real-time and check their expiration dates on-demand. Although this is an innovative feature, even these apps are facing challenges with user attraction and/or even retention.</p>
                            <p>What, then, is the issue?</p>

                            <h4>User Research - Phase 1</h4>
                            <p>The goals behind FoodTrack are simple - <b>to seek an answer to the above question, and in turn, to re-imagine the ultimate Food Tracker App.</b></p>
                            <p>With FoodTrack, users will find <b>2 primary features - and accordingly their purposes - at its core:</b></p>

                            <h3>Bringing Students to Healthy Meals</h3>
                            <hr class="star-primary">

                            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                            <p>Eating healthy is a challenge for a lot of students. For many, it is difficult to make time for nutritious meals in between classes and work. For others, a limited budget might be keeping them from actively choosing healthy food. This food culture enables a student body that prioritizes speed and convenience over health and food quality.</p>
                            <p>This project strives to gain a better understanding of the many barriers students face in making healthy food choices as they make their way around campus. Through various research methods, we want to learn the variety of behaviors that students exhibit towards healthy food options, and by doing so, our goal is <b>to design an engaging solution that will help students access healthier, more informed, and wholesome food within the UW vicinity.</b></p>

                            <h4>User Research</h4>
                            <p>Three primary research methods were utilized throughout the research process, including <b>Interviews, Surveys, and "Fly-On-The-Wall" Observations.</b></p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum user research.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>Affinity Diagram</b></p>
							<p>After reviewing all of our interview and observation notes, as well as the survey response summary, we got together and produced an Affinity Diagram as a group. Using sticky notes, each person posted on the board comments, patterns, and information we gathered from the researches. We then sorted them into groups based on intuitive relationships. This allowed us to come up with five groups in accordance with these themes:</p>
							<b><ol>
								<li>Time</li>
								<li>Social</li>
								<li>Attitudes toward Food</li> 
								<li>Uncertainties</li>
								<li>Lifestyle</li>
							</ol></b>
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum affinity diagram.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>Summary of Findings</b></p>
							<p>Among all of our research findings, <b>we are particularly interested in the following:</b></p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum summary 1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum summary 2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>User Design Requirements</b></p>
							<p>Based on the researching findings presented above, we came up with the following User Design Requirements. Each requirement should appropriately correlate with one or more of the findings:</p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum design requirements.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>User Characteristics/Design Question</b></p>
							<p>Accordingly, we were able to solidly define these User Characteristics:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Students who want to adopt healthier eating habits benefit from sharing peers’ experience.</li>
								<li>Peer influence can be a great motivation for students.</li>
								<li>Eating more healthily cannot compromise dynamic lifestyle and fast-paced schedule.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Which were then used to refine our principal Design Question:</p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum design question.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>Personas</b></p>
							<p>The following two Personas were produced in accordance with overall research findings:</p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum persona 1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum persona 2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

							<p><b>User Flow</b></p>
							<p>Similarly, an extensive User Flow was created to envision a potential user experience for Husky Yum. Divided into two parts, the top chart illustrates the onboarding process, while the bottom chart delineates the rest.</p>

							<h4>Sketches/Wireframes/Usability Testing</h4>
							<p><b>Sketches</b></p>
							<p>Early, quick & dirty Sketches were made to document, organize, and filter interesting ideas.</p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum sketch 1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>Wireframes</b></p>
							<p>These early sketches were then transformed into a set of Wireframes with specific desired features.</p>

							<p><b>Usability Testing</b></p>
							<p>Using the <b>"Think-Aloud Protocol" Method</b>, a usability test was conducted with a total number of 7 UW students.The test focused on the user’s ability to search, post and utilize other product features. Usability test tasks were designed to assess the accessibility and understandability of the end-to-end user flow for the app's major features.</p>

							</p><img src="img/portfolio/user test 1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<img src="img/portfolio/user test 2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

							<p>Participants of the usability test were both UW undergraduate and graduate students interested in healthy eating on and around campus.</p>

							<p>Concept-wise, the test revealed users' desire to see a focus on not only homemade meals/recipes, but also meals that they may discover from eating out at restaurants, bistros, cafes etc. In this regards, <b>the ability to find, discover, and share healthy "menu items" was an important addition of which the usability test has provided.</b></p>

							<p>On the other hand, below is a list of <b>other key findings and changes made:</b></p>

							<h4>Update/Next Steps</h4>
							<p>As part of the <b>HCDE 518 class</b>, our group had the chance to present Husky Yum to our instructors & peers at the end of the quarter. In this respect, the feedback provided to us were definitely very valuable. As such, they will continue to serve as an important lesson throughout our career.</p>
							<p><b>If I ever plan to continue with this project, nonetheless, here are a few things which I would like to work on next:</b></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Continue to conduct more user research & usability testing to discover design opportunities as well as test existing features.</li>
								<li>Explore different models & systems for the "Rating" feature.</li>
								<li>Explore different models & systems for the "Badge" feature.</li>
								<li>Explore more interaction design ideas.</li>
								<li>Further develop the recipe and/or menu item posting experience.</li>
							</ul>

                            <p>Amazon Web Services Internet of Things (AWS IoT) is a managed cloud platform that lets connected devices easily & securely interact with cloud applications and other devices. AWS IoT can support billions of devices and trillions of messages, and can process and route those messages to AWS endpoints and to other devices reliably & securely. With AWS IoT, applications can keep track of and communicate with all your devices, all the time, even when they aren’t connected. (Source: <a href="https://goo.gl/U6G0sQ">AWS IoT</a>)</p>
                            <p>AWS IoT makes it easy to use AWS services like AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon S3, Amazon Machine Learning, and Amazon DynamoDB to build IoT applications that gather, process, analyze and act on data generated by connected devices, without having to manage any infrastructure. (Source: <a href="https://goo.gl/U6G0sQ">AWS IoT</a>)</p>
                            <p><b>In an initiative to improve usability for the AWS IoT Console, Amazon has partnered with our team to design & conduct a baseline usability study for the product. The goal? To better understand  the end-to-end process of how developers can set up a development environment in AWS IoT with various devices connected, and effectively transfer data between these devices and the environment itself.</b></p>

                            <h4>Overview</h4>
                            <p>People use online behavior change programs, such as diets, exercise programs, financial plans to better their behavior. These are often one size fits all programs, not tailored to a person's needs & context. At the same time, many people who have already tried such programs have acquired knowledge on what works or doesn’t for themselves.</p>
                            <p>PlanSourcing is a tool that supports social recommendations for the creation of personalized step-by-step behavior change programs, using crowdsourced data that people track about their behavior. At the same time, the tool facilitates requests & recommendations for daily improvement of behavior between an individual and their friends or strangers who are interested in helping.</p>

                            <h4>Overview</h4>
                            <p>Building the capacity for regional resilience requires synthesis & understanding of a vast number of economic, social, ecological, and built environment indicators that each vary across space & time. To provide decision support to disaster & crisis stakeholders (e.g., utilities, emergency and business continuity managers) the hyper-dimensionality, complexity and uncertainty of regional resilience must be logically & visually represented in a manageable, comprehendible, and meaningful way. Visualization and the development of geo-visual user interfaces is one of the most under-developed areas of work for guiding restoration, reconstruction and recovery after extreme events, such as a Cascadia earthquake. </p>
                            <p>In this respect, RecoveryViz strives to serve as the state of the art visual analytics platform that can be effectively utilized to better support the process of disaster resilience decision-making.</p>
