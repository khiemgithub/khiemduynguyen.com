                            <h2>Pinky Swear Android App</h2>
                            <h3>Let's Get Productive!</h3>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS%20intro%20picture.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4>Overview & Goal</h4>
                            <p>Pinky Swear is an Android mobile application that strives to offer users a novel and fun way to stay productive. Initially developed as a side project, the primary idea was to allow a user (i.e. User A) make a "promise" to another randomly matched user (i.e. User B), who in turn will also have to make a promise to User A.</p> 
                            <p>A specific timeframe of 24 hours will be set for both users, and throughout the course, User A and B will have the chance to communicate with each another via a chat messenging tool - giving them a chance to encourage one another to fulfill his/her promise.</p>
                            <p>The catch? Once User A fulfills his/her promise in action, only User B can check it off on the app - thereby giving the app a collaborative nature overall. In a way, you can refer to Pinky Swear as a "collaborative to-do-list" app.</p>
                            <h4>Design Process</h4>
                         	<img src="img/portfolio/PS%20process.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4>User Research</h4>
                            <p>Quantitative user research was conducted in the form of a <b>Survey.</b> A total of 50 people were randomly chosen from friend and family circles, as well as the public. Below is a summary analysis of the process, along with important questions asked, associated responses, and data findings.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/ps-infographic.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>From the survey, <b>3 important numbers</b> that support the concept behind Pinky Swear receive the most attention:</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS%20research%20finding.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>From the indications above, <b>the last finding proves to be particularly important</b> as it revolves around a core feature of Pinky Swear - to make promises with one another and engage in a collaborative process in order to encourage each other's fulfillment of the respective promises - thereby illustrating a big opportunity.</p>
                            <p>Through the research, it is also interesting to find that our largest target audience consists of females aged between 18 and 49, and those who typically possess 1-4 actions they have to complete as well as be reminded of per day.</p>
                            <h4>Ideation/Sketches</h4>
                            <p>Early <b>Sketches</b> were followed after some brainstorming sessions.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS%20ideation2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4>User Flow/Wireframes</h4>
                            <p>Based on the user research, feedback, and early sketches - a high-fidelity <b>User Flow</b> and a set of <b>Wireframes</b> were created for <b>Usability Testing</b> purposes.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS%20wireframe%20page.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS%20user%20flow.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>The following are <b>important design decisions made:</b></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Provide "Sign Up With Facebook" as the only available registration option to speed up the onboarding process - making it the more easy and convenient for users to start using the app.</li>
                                <li>Provide 2 methods for creating promises:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Using "predefined promises" suggested by the app in order to get users started with Pinky Swear, while giving them a good idea of the promise types they could make.</li>
                                        <li>Customizing their own promises and essentially creating whatever the users wish.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Allow users to see the exact number of promises they've fulfilled ever since the app's initial download. This will serve as the motivational force.</li>
                                <li>Allow users to communicate with their matched partners via a chat messaging tool, in order to enhance the "fun" aspect. Once a promise is fulfilled in action, only the user's partner can check it off by tapping the "Fulfill" button.</li>
                                <li>Allow users to check the current progress of their promises, their matched partners' promises, and time left to fulfill the promises. At the same time, allow users to review past promises that either failed or were successfully fulfilled. These will serve as the "Overview" dashboards for users to get a good grasp of where they stand.</li>
                            </ul> 
                            <h4>Prototype/Usability Testing</h4>
                            <p>Using the wireframes above, an <b>Interactive Prototype</b> was created to test on 10 users. Their feedback was then incorporated into the next design iteration.</p>
                            <p><b>The following are key changes:</b></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>On the screen where users can see the exact number of promises they've fulfilled ever since the app's download, a small motivational message can accompany the number. Depending on the range within which the number is located, the message could be different. In this regards, the respective ranges would be:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>1 to 24</li>
                                        <li>25 to 49</li>
                                        <li>50 to 74</li>
                                        <li>75 to 100</li>
                                        <li>100+</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Allow users to add images and emoticons within the chat messaging tool. Images can help with the "evidence" factor, giving users a way to prove that they have indeed carried out an action and fulfilled their promises. Emoticons will help to make the chats more fun and inviting.</li>
                                <li>Include "Popular" as one of the promise categories. This will contain the most commonly used promises within the Pinky Swear community.</li>
                                <li>White background with soft flat colors on top to complement the clean and minimalist design concept.</li>
                                <li>Big, bold buttons and generally easily identifiable action items.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>High-Fidelity Designs - Final</h4>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS%20high%20fidel%201.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS%20high%20fidel%203.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4>Releases</h4>
                            <p>After roughly 4 months of design, development, as well as marketing efforts, the 1st version of Pinky Swear was released onto Google Play in June 2015. While the initial plan was to only build the app for fun, opportunities where Pinky Swear's current as well as potential features could be further developed were explored.</p> 
                            <p><b>A 2nd round of usability testing</b> was conducted using the functional app (5 participants), and below are <b>key changes/additions:</b></p>          <ul>
                                <li>Implement a "match up with Facebook friends" feature. This will allow users who feel uncomfortable about being matched with strangers to find partners within their friend or family circles.</li>
                                <li>Implement a pop-up notification which says "Well done! You've just fulfilled a promise" after the user's partner checks off his/her promise. This can appear on any screens in the app, or even outside of the app.</li>
                                <li>Implement pop-up notifications that inform users of promise deadlines approaching, AND promises that have passed deadlines.</li>
                                <li>Implement a simple 1-page tutorial that will teach users how to use Pinky Swear. This screen will be automatically visible to newly registered users as soon as they log in for the first time.
                                    <ul>
                                	   <li>Implement a "Tutorial" button located next to the "Profile" button. This will allow users to access the Tutorial page at all time.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>                          
                            <p>Feedback from the usability test allowed us to release Pinky Swear V.2 in November 2015.</p>

                            <h4>Update</h4>
                            <p>As of March 2016, the decision had been made to discontinue Pinky Swear's operation, due to a lack of market interest. With well <b>over 500 downloads</b> throughout its lifetime, this concluded our one year of experience with this very special project - one that had taught us a great lesson about the end-to-end cycle of agile product development. More importantly, we've given ourselves the chance to appreciate the significance of teamwork and collaboration as a component of success.</p>
                            <p><b>With Pinky Swear, I've personally had the opportunity to ship my first ever design as a UX professional.</b> As such, the app will always maintain a very special spot in my heart. Thank you to everyone who has shown and continues to offer your support to Pinky Swear. This experience wouldn't have been possible without all of you. :)</p>

                            <h4>Overview</h4>
                            <p>Amazon Web Services Internet of Things (AWS IoT) is a managed cloud platform that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices. AWS IoT can support billions of devices and trillions of messages, and can process and route those messages to AWS endpoints and to other devices reliably and securely. With AWS IoT, applications can keep track of and communicate with all your devices, all the time, even when they aren’t connected. (Source: <a href="https://goo.gl/U6G0sQ">AWS IoT</a>)</p>
                            <p>AWS IoT makes it easy to use AWS services like AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon S3, Amazon Machine Learning, and Amazon DynamoDB to build IoT applications that gather, process, analyze and act on data generated by connected devices, without having to manage any infrastructure. (Source: <a href="https://goo.gl/U6G0sQ">AWS IoT</a>)</p>
                            <p><b>In an initiative to improve usability for the AWS IoT Console, Amazon has partnered with our team to design and conduct a baseline usability study for the product. The goal? To better understand  the end-to-end process of how developers can set up a development environment in AWS IoT with various devices connected, and effectively transfer data between these devices and the environment itself.</b></p>
                            <p>Through close collaboration with the AWS IoT's User Research Team, <b>we had the opportunity to participate in every stage of the process’s timeline, which include:</b></p>

                            <h3>Bringing Students to Healthy Meals</h3>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum%20intro%20pic.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                            <p>Eating healthy is a challenge for a lot of students. For many, it is difficult to make time for nutritious meals in between classes and work. For others, a limited budget might be keeping them from actively choosing healthy food. This food culture enables a student body that prioritizes speed and convenience over health and food quality.</p>
                            <p>This project strives to gain a better understanding of the many barriers students face in making healthy food choices as they make their way around campus. Through various research methods, we want to learn the variety of behaviors that students exhibit towards healthy food options, and by doing so, our goal is <b>to design an engaging solution that will help students access healthier, more informed, and wholesome food within the UW vicinity.</b></p>
                            <h4>User Research</h4>
                            <p>Three primary research methods were utilized throughout the research process, including <b>Interviews, Surveys, and "Fly-On-The-Wall" Observations.</b></p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum%20user%20research.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>Affinity Diagram</b></p>
							<p>After reviewing all of our interview and observation notes, as well as the survey response summary, we got together and produced an Affinity Diagram as a group. Using sticky notes, each person posted on the board comments, patterns, and information we gathered from the researches. We then sorted them into groups based on intuitive relationships. This allowed us to come up with <b>five groups in accordance with these themes:</b></p>
							<ol>
								<li>Time</li>
								<li>Social</li>
								<li>Attitudes toward Food</li> 
								<li>Uncertainties</li>
								<li>Lifestyle</li>
							</ol>
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum%20affinity%20diagram.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>Summary of Findings</b></p>
							<p>Among all of our research findings, <b>we are particularly interested in the following:</b></p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum%20summary.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>User Characteristics/Design Question/Personas</b></p>
							<p>Based on the researching findings presented above, we were able to define the following User Characteristics:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Students who want to adopt healthier eating habits benefit from sharing peers’ experience.</li>
                                <li>Peer influence can be a great motivation for students.</li>
                                <li>Eating more healthily cannot compromise dynamic lifestyle and fast-paced schedule.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Within the context of these characteristics, we refined our Design Question, and accordingly came up with two primary Personas:</p>
                            <p><i>"How can we utilize <strong>PEER INFLUENCE</strong> to motivate UW students to eat more healthily while keeping up with a busy schedule?"</i></p>

							<p><b>User Design Requirements</b></p>
                            <p>Lastly, these User Design Requirements are solidified. Each requirement should appropriately correlate with one or more of the findings:</p>

							<h4>Sketches/Wireframes/Usability Testing</h4>
							<p><b>Sketches</b></p>
							<p>Early, quick and dirty Sketches were made to document, organize, and filter interesting ideas.</p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum%20sketch%201.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>Wireframes</b></p>
							<p>These early sketches were then transformed into a set of Wireframes with specific desired features. Below is a selected sample:</p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/huskyyum%20alpha.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p><b>Usability Testing</b></p>
							<p>Using the <b>"Think-Aloud Protocol" Method</b>, a usability test was conducted with a total number of 7 UW students. The test focused on the user’s ability to search, post and utilize other product features. Usability test tasks were designed to assess the accessibility and understandability of the end-to-end user flow for the app's major features.</p>
							<img src="img/portfolio/user%20test%202.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
							<p>Participants of the usability test were both UW undergraduate and graduate students interested in healthy eating on and around campus.</p>
							<p>Concept-wise, the test revealed users' desire to see a focus on not only homemade meals/recipes, but also meals that they may discover from eating out at restaurants, bistros, cafes etc. In this regards, <b>the ability to find, discover, and share healthy "menu items" was an important addition of which the usability test has provided.</b></p>
							<p>On the other hand, below is a list of <b>other key findings and changes made:</b></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>ISSUE:</b> Users are confused about the process of sharing a new homemade recipe.</li>

                                    <li>Implement a vivid "Post" button on the "Trending" page.</li>
                                    <li>Remove the ability to share and ask about existing recipes.</li>
                                    <li>Allow users to access the "Search" and "Post" features from the burger menu.</li>
                                    <li>Develop the burger menu to include all of these options: My Profile, Search Recipes, Search Menu Items, Post Recipes, and Post Menu Items.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li><b>ISSUE:</b> Users can't locate the "Search" feature to filter and find recipes.</li>
                                <p><b>SOLUTIONS</b></p>

                                <li><b>ISSUE:</b> Users don't quite understand what the "Trending" page means (where the top meals as rated by the Husky Yum community are listed).</li>
                                <p><b>SOLUTIONS</b></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Redesign the "Trending" page's user interface to make it more visual with less text.</li>
                                    <li>Include a photo of the homademade recipe or menu item in question.</li>
                                    <li>Present only the top 5 homademade recipes or menu items as rated by the HuskyYum community.</li>
                                    <li>Allow users to easily navigage through the top 5 homemade recipes or menu items by swiping right or left.</li>
                                    <li>Implement two tabs close to the top of the screen, "Homemade" and "Eat-out", so users can conveniently view either the top 5 homemade recipes or menu items.</li>

							<h4><b>High-Fidelity Designs</b></h4>
							<p> The collected data from the usability test allowed us to make significant changes to our wireframes, which are then transformed into High-Fidelity Designs with a proper color palette and iconography usage.</p>
                            <p>Below is an interactive prototype that delineates the user onboarding process, as well as one of the primary workflows which Husky Yum strives to offer: <b>Searching For a Healthy Homemade Recipe</b>. Simply follow these steps:</p>
                            <iframe src="https://marvelapp.com/131ga8d?emb=1" width="289" height="593" style="float:right" allowTransparency="true" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Tap on "Sign Up".</li>
                                <li>Mentally fill in the text fields. Tap on "Next".</li>
                                <li>Mentally turn on/off diet filters. Tap on "Submit".</li>
                                <li>Swipe-Left to check 2nd Recipe in the "Top 5 Recipes" list (simply click on the right side of the screen).</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Search" icon.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Add Ingredient" sign. Repeat this step twice. Make sure to always tap on the sign next to a blank field.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Search".</li>
                                <li>Tap on the "Veggie Fried Rice" box.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Save" to save "Veggie Fried Rice" from its profile.</li>

                            <p>Find saved recipes via these steps:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Tap on "Burger Menu" icon.</li>

                            </ol>
                            <p>With a significant number of users expressing a desire to see a similar process for <b>Healthy Menu Items</b> found outside of the home kitchen, here's a another quick interactive prototype which effectively illustrates this flow:</p>
                            <iframe src="https://marvelapp.com/1i9i2ha?emb=1" width="241" height="494" style="float:right" allowTransparency="true" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Tap on "Eat-out".</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Search" icon.</li>
                                <li>Mentally fill in all the fields.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Search".</li>
                                <li>Tap on the "Crab Fried Rice" box.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Save" to save "Crab Fried Rice" from its profile.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Burger Menu" icon.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Profile" box.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Saved Recipes & Menu Items".</li>

                            </ol>
                            <p>One last important scenario that is equally important to the Husky Yum design concept is the creation of new recipes and/or menu items to be shared on the app. Here, we follow the steps for <b>Posting a New Healthy Homemade Recipe</b> as an example:

                            <ol>
                                <li>Tap on "Add/Post" icon.</li>
                                <li>Mentally fill in all the fields. Tap on "Instructions" box to edit.</li>
                                <li>Mentally fill in "Step 1" field. Tap on "Add Step 2". Mentally fill in "Step 2" field. Tap on "Add Step 3". Mentally fill in "Step 3" field. Tap on "Complete".</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Post".</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Burger Menu" icon.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Profile" box.</li>
                                <li>Tap on "Posted Recipes & Menu Items".</li>
                            </ol>
							<h4>Future Directions</h4>
							<p>As part of our <b>HCDE 518 class</b>, we had the chance to present Husky Yum to our instructors and peers at the end of the quarter. In this respect, the feedback provided to us were definitely very valuable. As such, they will continue to serve as an important lesson throughout our career.</p>
							<p><b>If I ever plan to continue with this project, nonetheless, here are a few things which I would like to work on next:</b></p>
							<ul>
								<li>Continue to conduct more user research and usability testing to discover design opportunities as well as test existing features.</li>
								<li>Explore different models and systems for the "Rating" feature.</li>
								<li>Explore different models and systems for the "Badge" feature.</li>
								<li>Explore more interaction/transition design ideas.</li>
								<li>Further develop the "Recipe and/or Menu Item Posting" experience.</li>
							</ul>

                        <h3>Version Upgrade: 3.5</h3>
                            <hr class="star-primary">

                            <h4>Overview</h4>
                            <p>Joomla! is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) for publishing web content. It is built on a model–view–controller web application framework that can be used independently of the CMS.</p>
                            <p><b>As part of the product development roadmap, the Production Leadership Team has decided to execute a complete redesign project for the next version of the system, Joomla 3.5 (web & mobile).</b></p>
                            <p>Volunteers around the world were recruited for this project, and I was very fortunate to have obtained the role of UX Designer/Developer - <b> responsible for driving the end-to-end UX Design process, from user research, low-fidelity wireframing, usability testing, to eventual high-fidelity graphic design.</b></p>
                            <p>At the same time, I was given the formidable opportunity to <b>collaborate with other teams on redesigning/developing the two most visited Joomla domains - Joomla.org and Joomla.com - in an initiative to improve user sign up rates and branding.</b></p>

                            <h4>Design Samples</h4>
                            <p>Below is a slideshow of some design samples created for <b>Joomla.org.</b> Press the "Play" button, and simply click on the right-most area of the screen to see the next design. Click on the left-most area of the screen to revisit the previous design. Note that this is not an interactive prototype.</p>

                        	<h4>Still Curious?</h4>
                        	<p>In March 2016, I left the Joomla project to pursue other academic/professional goals. Nonetheless, the lessons I've learnt from this experience will always be irreplaceable as I continue to advance on in my UX career. At the same time, the opportunity to have met and befriended some of the most wonderful and talented people around the world was truly an amazing gift.</p>

                            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                            <p>Many people today find themselves with amazing tech ideas and all the motivation required to transform these ideas into meaningful products/applications, and yet they typically experience difficulties getting started. Why?</p>
                            <p>This occurence is normally due to such individuals' lack of certain skill sets or field knowledge (i.e. they can code but they cannot design). At the same time, many talented professionals may want to contribute their skills to tech-oriented projects that are interesting or meaningful to them, and yet they often find it challenging to discover these ideas as well as those who own them.</p>
                            <h4>Competitive/Comparative Analysis</h4>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/collab%20competitive%20analysis.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>There exists a good number of websites today that specifically serve to connect individuals/organizations with freelancers who may be needed for certain projects. These resources, however, are typically designed as marketplaces rather than social networks. Hence, the majority of projects sourced via these sites are likely to be contract-based. Clients will simply aim to hire additional employees to get a job done. In turn, this approach limits the opportunity for passionate individuals who share a common interest to meet and collaborate.</p>
                            <p>Illustrated above are 5 popular "freelance marketplaces" commonly used by organizations and professionals today.</p>
                            <h4>User Research - Phase 1</h4>
                            <p>To offer a response to this market gap, <b>Collab wants to provide a tool which can:</b></p> 
                            <img src="img/portfolio/collab%20features.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>The ultimate objective? <b>To build an application where projects/ideas receive the main spotlight, while owners and collaborators have a place where they can connect, collaborate, and build products that can change the world.</b></p>
                            <p>To better understand the target audience, a few <b>Assumptions</b> were made around these questions:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>WHO</b> are the potential users?</li>
                                <li><b>WHAT</b> do they want to accomplish?</li>
                                <li><b>WHERE</b> do they wish to accomplish these tasks?</li>
                                <li><b>WHY</b> do they want to accomplish these tasks?</li>
                                <li><b>WHEN</b> do they want to accomplish these tasks?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/collab%20screening.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>And to better understand the users' needs and challenges, qualitative 1-hour long <b>Interviews</b> were conducted with 5 interviewees. Below is a list of questions asked, and a brief insight into the interviewees' profiles:</p>

                            <h4>Sketches/Wireframes</h4>
                            <p>Based on overall research findings - early, quick and dirty <b>Sketches</b> were made to document, organize, and filter interesting ideas.</p> 
                            <img src="img/portfolio/collab%20sketch%202.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>The best ideas were then iterated into clear <b>Wireframes</b> that come with a set of desired features.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/collab%20wireframes.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
                            <p>A <b>Usability Test</b> was conducted via the <b>"Think-Aloud Protocol" Method.</b> The primary goal was to elicit user feedback in order to help refine Collab's overall interaction as well as interface design. Usability test tasks were designed to assess the accessibility and understandability of the end-to-end user flow for the app's major features.</p>
                            <p>A total of 5 users were recruited to help with the testing process. They were screened according to the following attributes:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Currently working or studying in any industries, areas, or disciplines related to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).</li>
                                <li>At least an undergraduate college student.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Following the test's conduction, <b>below is a list key findings recorded:</b></p>

                            <h4>High-Fidelity Design</h4>
                            <p>As the usability test has illustrated, <b>two new features</b> are to be implemented.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/collab%20new%20features.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>The wireframes are then transformed into <b>High-Fidelity Designs</b> with a proper color palette and iconography usage. Here's a snapshot of the Welcome Page (left), and a slideshow of the some design samples (right). Simply click the left-most area of the screen to advance to the next screen, and right-most to revisit the previous screen. If the screen slides up or down, it is an indication that it belongs to the same page as the previous or next screen, respectively. Note that this is not an interactive prototype.</p>

                            <p>In October 2015, I had the amazing opportunity to present Collab to a group of angel investors and entrepreneurs at the <b>Seattle Startup Week</b> event. Although I have no intention in pursuing the idea fully as a business, the feedback and advices given to me were more than invaluable.</p>

                                <li>Design the "Chat Messaging" experience.</li>
                                <li>Conduct more user research and usability testing to further validate the idea, as well as test on current features.</li>
                                <li>Explore more interaction/transition design ideas.</li>
                                <li>Explore ways in which users can better discover each other as well as interesting projects.</li>

                            <h3>Designing For The Global Audience</h3>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/vnintro.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                            <h4>Overview</h4>
                            <p>With Vietnam becoming increasingly economically & politically integrated with the world, VnExpress (known to be the most popular E-Newspaper in Vietnam) sees a great opportunity & need to extend its reach to a growing portion of global readers who share a mutual interest in the country's affairs. <b>This ultimately lead to the executive decision to design & build Vietnam International - the English Version of VnExpress - with the hope of bringing more Vietnamese as well as ASEAN news to the world.</b></p>
                            
                            <p><b>I was very fortunate to have obtained the opportunity to connect & collaborate with the VnExpress Design Team for this project - in the role of a Web Designer/Developer (responsible for all aspects of the research & design process).</b> Beginning in late 2015, we were finally able to launch the full website (web & mobile) for VnExpress International to our global readers in April 2016.</p>

                            <p>From a personal perspective, this project has offered me a truly educational experience. Besides the enriching learnings I had within the realm of Responsive Web Design, the chance to build the international version of an E-News platform has taught me the mechanism of Localization and its significant role in product design as the world we live in becomes the more globalized.</p>

                            <h4>Final Designs</h4>
                            <p>Due to the project's strict NDA, I won't be able to showcase many of the design assets and/or data created throughout the project's timeline. Nonetheless, below is one particular example of an important design decision made regarding the <b>Content Positioning</b> of VnExpress and its international counterpart. While most of the important design differences revolve around the Information Architecture & Content Strategy between the two versions, this feature has emerged as the most interesting component to me.</p>
                            <p><b>VIETNAMESE</b></p>
                            <p>From our user research (primarily through <b>Eye-Tracking/Heat Map Analysis</b> methods), it was revealed that a lot of Vietnamese readers have the tendency to view VnExpress's content via the <b>F-Shaped Pattern</b> - a concept that was first explored by UX expert Jakob Nielsen, who has conducted numerous tests on the ways users read web content. Essentially:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Users first read in a horizontal movement, usually across the upper part of the content area. This initial element forms the F's top bar.</li>
                                <li>Next, users move down the page a bit and then read across in a second horizontal movement that typically covers a shorter area than the previous movement. This additional element forms the F's lower bar.</li>
                                <li>Finally, users scan the content's left side in a vertical movement. Sometimes this is a fairly slow and systematic scan that appears as a solid stripe on an eyetracking heatmap. Other times users move faster, creating a spottier heatmap. This last element forms the F's stem.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><i>(From <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/">"F-Shaped Pattern For Reading Web Content"</a> by Jakob Nielsen)</i></p>
                            <p>As such, our research data has shown that Vietnamese users like to see content blocks listed in a vertical manner, in which they can quickly scroll through the site and browse for their preferred content. This is evident in both the Home Page & Article Page of the Vietnamese site.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/vnmockup1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                            <p><b>Home Page</b></p>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/vn2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                            <p><b>Article Page</b></p>

                            <p><b>INTERNATIONAL</b></p>
                            <p>On the other hand, international readers have illustrated a mixed approach to viewing web content. While some follow the aforementioned F-Shaped Pattern, a significantly large portion of others have delineated a pattern that's more <b>"Z-Shaped"</b> in nature. In essence, users' content-viewing behavior is still naturally fast, in which they would typically begin by skimming quickly horizontally across the page. Nonetheless, rather than immediately moving on to scanning the content in a vertical movement, there's a tendency to prolong the original horizontal approach in an attempt to seek out for more interesting articles.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly, a design decision has been made to implement a hybrid pattern where components of both the F-Shape & Z-Shape frameworks are optimized for VnExpress International. As one can see, content blocks are positioned in such a way that will allow for both effective vertical & horizontal viewing.</p>

                            <p>Interestingly, mobile users have illustrated a consistent behavior amongst both Vietnamese and English readers. As shown below, this has influenced the general design for both versions of VnExpress to be relatively similar. The only key differences are only present to the extent of ensuring a sense of visual consistency between the web & mobile versions of the two sites, as well as the relevant information architecture/content strategy.</p>
