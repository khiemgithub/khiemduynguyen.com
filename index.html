                            <h3>Let's Get Productive!</h3>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS intro picture.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <h4>Overview & Goal</h4>
                            <p>Pinky Swear is an Android mobile application that strives to offer users a novel & fun way to stay productive. Initially developed as a side project, the primary idea was to <b>allow a user (i.e. User A) make a "promise" to another randomly matched user (i.e. User B), who in turn will also have to make a promise to User A.</b></p> 

                            <p>A specific timeframe of 24 hours will be set for both users, and throughout the course, <b>User A and B will have the chance to communicate with each another via a chat messenging tool</b> - giving them a chance to encourage one another to fulfill his/her promise.</p>

                            <p>The catch? <b>Once User A fulfills his/her promise in action, only User B can check it off on the app</b> - thereby giving the app a collaborative nature overall. In a way, you can refer to Pinky Swear as a "collaborative to-do-list" app.</p>

                            <h4>Design Process</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>User Research</li>
                                <li>Ideation/Sketches</li>
                                <li>User Flow Diagram/Wireframes</li>
                                <li>Prototype/Usability Testing</li>
                                <li>High Fidelity Design</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>User Research</h4>
                            <p>Quantitative user research was conducted in the forms of surveys. A total of 50 people were randomly chosen from friend and family circles, as well as the public. Below is a summary analysis of the process, along with important questions asked, associated responses, and data findings.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS infographic.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>From the survey, <b>3 important indications</b> that support the concept behind Pinky Swear were solidified:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The market for "to-do-list" apps proves to be promising, with 75% of respondents already using an app of this kind.</li>

                                <li>A clear majority (85%) stated that they would consider a new app alternative, providing a definite cue to enter the market.</li>

                                <li><b>More than half of the respondents (56%) said that they would try-out the idea of "having another person act as a pushing force behind the completion process of their personal to do lists".</b> This last finding proves to be particularly important as it revolves around a core feature of Pinky Swear - to make promises with one another and engage in a collaborative process in order to encourage each other's fulfillment of the respective promises - thereby illustrating a big opportunity.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Through the research findings, it is also interesting to find that <b>our largest target audience consists of females aged between 18 and 49, and those who typically possess 1-4 actions they have to complete as well as be reminded of per day.</b></p>

                            <h4>Ideation/Sketches</h4>
                            <p>Early sketches and a user flow draft were followed after some brainstorming sessions.</p>

                            <h4>User Flow Diagram/Wireframes</h4>
                            <p>Based on the user research, feedback, and early sketches - a high-fidelity user flow diagram and a set of wireframes were created for usability testing purposes.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS wireframe page.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS user flow.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>The following are <b>important design decisions made:</b></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Provide "Sign Up With Facebook" as the the only available registration option to speed up the onboarding process - making it the more easy as well as convenient for users to start using the app.</li>
                                <li>Provide 2 methods for creating promises: 
                                	<ul>
                                		<li>Using "predefined promises" suggested by the app in order to get users started with Pinky Swear, while giving them a good idea of the promise types they could make.</li>
                                		<li>Customizing their own promises and essentially creating anything the users wish.</li>
                                	</ul>
                                <li> Allow users to check the current progress of their promises, their matched partners' promises, and time left to fulfill the promises. At the same time, allow users to review past promises that either failed or were successfully fulfilled. These will serve as the essential "Overview" screens for users to get a good grasp of where they stand.</li>
                                <li>Allow users to communicate with their matched partners via a chat messenging tool, in order to enhance the "fun" aspect. Once a promise is fulfilled in action, only the user's partner can check it off on the app by tapping a "Fulfill" button.</li>
                                <li>Allow users to see the exact number of promises they've fulfilled ever since the app's download. This will serve as a motivational force.</li>
                                <li> In accordance with Android's design styleguide, implementation of Top Navigation Bar with ability to seamlessly navigate different screens by swiping between the tabs.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Prototype/Usability Testing</h4>
                            <p>Using the wireframes above, an interactive prototype was created to test on 10 users. Their feedback was then incorporated into the next design iteration.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/PS usability testing.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p><b>The following are key changes:</b></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>On the screen where users can see the exact number of promises they've fulfilled ever since the app's download, a small motivational message can accompany the number. Depending on the range within which the number is located, the message could be different. In this regard, the respective ranges would be:</li>
                                <ul>
                                	<li>1-24</li>
                                	<li>25-49</li> 
                                	<li>50-74</li> 
                                	<li>75-100</li> 
                                	<li>100+</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>Allow users to add images & emoticons within the chat messenging tool. Images can help with the "evidence" factor, giving users a way to prove that they have indeed carried out an action and fulfilled their promises. Emoticons will help to make the chats more fun & inviting.</li>
                                <li>Include "Popular" as one of the promise categories. This will contain the most commonly used promises within the Pinky Swear community.</li>
                                <li>White background with soft flat colors on top to complement the clean & minimalist design concept.</li>
                                <li>Big, bold buttons and generally easily identifiable action items.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Current Progress/Update</h4>
                            <p>After roughly 4 months of design & development, the 1st version of Pinky Swear was released onto Google Play. While the initial plan was to only build the app for fun, opportunities where Pinky Swear's current as well as potential features could be further developed were explored. A 2nd round of usability testing via user interviews was conducted using the functional app (5 participants), and below are <b>key changes/additions:</b></p>                          
                            <ul>
                                <li>Implement a "match up with Facebook friends" feature. This will allow users who feel uncomfortable about being matched with strangers to find partners within their friend or family circles.</li>
                                <li>Implement a pop-up notification which says <b>"Well done! You've just fulfilled a promise"</b> after the user's partner checks off his/her promise. This can appear on any screens in the app, or even outside of the app.</li>
                                <li>Implement pop-up notifications that inform users of promise deadlines approaching, AND promises that have passed deadlines.</li>
                                <li>Implement a simple 1-page tutorial that will teach users how to use Pinky Swear. This screen will be automatically visible to newly registered users as soon as they log in for the first time.</li>
                                <ul>
                                	<li>Implement a "Tutorial" button located next to the "Profile" button. This will allow users to access the Tutorial page at all time.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </ul>                          
                            <p style="margin-bottom:35px;">Pinky Swear is currently in the redesign process and have since been taken off Google Play. As soon as the 2nd version is ready for release, rest assured that you will be updated. Stay tuned!</p>

                            <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                            <p>A lot of aspiring entrepreneurs today, or essentially any inspired individuals, find themselves with an amazing tech idea. They have all the motivation required to transform these ideas into meaningful products/applications, and yet they typically experience difficulties getting started. Why?</p>
                            <p><b>This occurence is normally due to these individuals' lack of certain skill sets or field knowledge</b> (e.g. they can code but they cannot design). At the same time, many talented professionals may want to contribute their skills to tech-oriented projects that are interesting or meaningful to them, and yet <b>they often find it challenging to discover these ideas as well as those who own them.</b></p>

                            <h4>Competitive/Comparative Analysis</h4>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/collab competitive analysis.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p><b>There exists a good number of websites today that specifically serve to connect individuals/organizations with freelancers who may be needed for certain projects.</b> These resources, however, are normally designed as marketplaces rather than social networks. Hence, the majority, if not all, of projects sourced via these sites are likely to be contract-based. Clients will simply aim to hire additional employees to get a job done. In turn, this approach limits the opportunity for passionate individuals who share a common interest to meet & collaborate.</p>
                            <p>Illustrated above are <b>5 popular "freelance marketplaces"</b> commonly used by organizations & professionals today.</p>

                            <h4>User Research</h4>
                            <p>To offer a response to this market gap, <b>Collab wants to provide a medium through which:</b></p> 
                            <ul>
                            	<li>Idea owners can share their tech projects, and find people to help with the execution phase.</li>
                            	<li>Potential collaborators can find/discover these projects.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><b>The ultimate objective?</b> To build an application where projects/ideas receive the main spotlight, while owners & collaborators have a place where they can connect, collaborate, and build products that can change the world.</p>
                            <p>To better understand the target audience, <b>a few screening questions were asked</b>, mainly:</p>
                            <ol>
                            	<li><b>WHO</b> are the potential users?</li>
                            	<li><b>WHAT</b> do they want to accomplish?</li>
                            	<li><b>WHERE</b> do they wish to accomplish these tasks?</li>
                            	<li><b>WHY</b> do they want to accomplish these tasks?</li>
                            	<li><b>WHEN</b> do they want to accomplish these tasks?</li>
                            </ol>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/collab screening.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>And to better understand the users' needs & challenges, <b>qualitative 1-hour long interviews were conducted with 5 interviewees.</b> Below is a list of questions asked, and a brief insight into the interviewees' profiles:</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/collab profile_questions.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>From the interviews, <b>5 key conclusions were drawn:</b>
                            <ol>
                            	<li>A relatively large number of professionals who work in the tech industry enjoy spending their spare time working on independent side projects.</li>
                            	<li>Collaboration is perceived as an important, if not vital, factor within the development process of a successful project.</li>
                            	<li>The most commonly applied networking method when it comes to recruiting team members is through personal connections. Social media is generally cited as the only technical tool used throughout this process.</li>
                            	<li>Learning new skills to execute a project is only neccessary when the individual is interested in acquiring these skills. Otherwise, it is more favorable to have an expert do the job.</li>
                            	<li>What remains as the most critical factor when deciding to build or join a project is the person's passion & interest in the idea, not the potential financial gains.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>These findings allow the <b>creation of 2 personas shown below:</b></p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/collab personas.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <p><b>2 primary user stories along with potential user requirements</b> were formulated based on Bob's & Ryan's personas, respectively:</p>
                            <ol>
                            	<li>Ability to find & network with people, and</li>
                            	<li>Ability to find projects of interest.</li>

                            <h4>Current Progress/Updates</h4>
							<p>Presently, a <b>content strategy & information architecture</b> are being drafted. This step strives to better solidify the user research data, and accordingly help visualize a set of potential features/user experience that can help fulfill the proposed user requirements.
							<p>Some early, quick & dirty sketches are also being made to document, organize, and filter interesting ideas.</p>

                             <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                            <p>It is common for consumers to <b>buy a lot of food without checking the expiration date</b> on each particular item, and end up <b>disposing a big chunk few days later.</b> Such a habit can lead to frustrations, and subsequently a lot of <b>money wasted on spoiled food that can't be used or eaten.</b></p>
                            <p>At the same time, for those who spend a lot of time grocery shopping & cooking, buying too much can <b>make food management a difficult task.</b> Food items getting spoiled is typically the result of their owners completely forgetting about them.</p>
                           
                            <h4>Competitive/Comparative Analysis</h4>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/foodtrack competitive analysis.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>A simple search for "food expiration date tracker app" on Google Play will return with more than dozens of apps that strive to fulfill this purpose - and that's just Android (the illustration above only shows those which are free).</p>
                            <p>Indeed, <b>the market for food tracker apps is relatively saturated.</b> Nonetheless, a quick analysis will show that <b>rarely do these apps end up in the "popular" group.</b> The highest recorded number of downloads is approximately 10,000. Others normally strike somewhere between 50 and 1000.</p>
                            <p>While the majority of food tracker apps commonly share <b>1 basic feature - allowing users to add/remove/edit food items manually</b>, along with the associated data - <b>a small number of tech-savvier apps has introduced the barcode scanning feature</b>, which allow users to scan food items in real-time and check their expiration dates on-demand. Undoubtedly, this is an innovative feature which warrants some consideration. However, like their non-barcode-scanning-driven counterparts, even these apps are <b>facing challenges with user attraction and/or even retention.</b></p>
                            <p>What, then, is the issue?</p>


                            <h4>User Research</h4>
                            <p>The goals behind FoodTrack are simple - to seek an answer to the above question, and in turn to re-imagine the ultimate Food Tracker App.</p>
                            <p>With FoodTrack, users will find <b>2 primary features at its core:</b></p>
                            <ol>
                            	<li>Ability to review & manage food items they have in store.</li>
                            	<li>Ability to track the items' shelf-life.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Which, accordingly, will help them to:</p>
                            <ul>
                            	<li>Make use of items that will spoil in the near future.</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p><b>Screening questions</b> were asked to better understand the target audience, as well as to reaffirm the market need. These questions include:</p>
                            <ol>
                            	<li><b>WHO</b> are the potential users?</li>
                            	<li><b>WHAT</b> do they want to accomplish?</li>
                            	<li><b>WHERE</b> do they wish to accomplish these tasks?</li>
                            	<li><b>WHY</b> do they want to accomplish these tasks?</li>
                            	<li><b>WHEN</b> do they want to accomplish these tasks?</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p><b>A quantitative survey</b> was then conducted within a group of 50 users, out of whom 10 were selected for an <b>interview</b> revolved around the question:</p>
                            <p><b>"Would you like to describe your general experience managing your food at home?"</b></p> 
                            <p>Below is a snapshot of the process, including a summary of overall data findings:</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/foodtrack user research phase 1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>From this research study, <b>2 primary conclusions</b> were made about the participants' food management behavior.</p>
                            <ol>
                            	<li>The opportunity for food tracker apps to thrive within the market is alive & well. Most people:</li>
                            	<ul>
                            		<li>Don't know all the food items they own (85%).</li>
                            		<li>Have thrown away food due to spoilage at some point in their life (92%).</li>
                            		<li>Have a disorganized & messy fridge with too many items in it (88%).</li>
                            		<li>DON'T use any kind of mobile apps to manage & check their food's shelf life. 47 out of 50 participants in the survey indicated this - which delineates the lack of appeal characterized by a vast number of food tracker apps available in the market today.</li>
                            	</ul>
                            	<li><b>MONEY SAVING</b> serves as a fundamental force of motivation behind people's need for a more efficient way to manage their food. This point is clearly illustrated through:</li>
                            	<ul>
                            		<li>The survey participants - 80% of whom agree that "money" was the most distressing factor accompanying food spoilage.</li> 
                            		<li>The few selected interviewees - all of whom proclaimed that they are "wasting too much money on spoiled food".</li>
                            	</ul>
                            </ol>

                            <p>What followed was a quick brainstorming session to work out <b>a general persona and 3 principal user stories (as well as potential requirements)</b> - 2 of which were previously discussed as "Manage Food Inventory" and "Check Food Shelf Life", while a third feature was added based on the research finding:</p>
                            <p><b>"Ability to "Review Food Expenses (Fresh & Spoiled)"".</b></p>
                            <p>A raw <b>user flow diagram</b> was also included, all of which can be seen below:</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/foodtrack user research phase 2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

							<h4>Current Progress/Updates</h4>
							<p>Presently, a <b>content strategy & information architecture</b> are being drafted. This step strives to better solidify the user research data, and accordingly help visualize a set of potential features/user experience that can help fulfill the proposed user requirements.
							<p>Some early, quick & dirty sketches are also being made to document, organize, and filter interesting ideas.</p>
