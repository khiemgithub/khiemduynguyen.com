                  <p class="italic">(Photo from <a href="http://www.wsj.com/">Wall Street Journal</a>)</p>
                  <h2>Tension In The Waters</h2>
                  <p>Although tensions between China and Vietnam over the disputed South China Sea have been going on for years, it was only recently when these two countries escalate this conflict to an unprecedented high level. Stemming from a deep sea drilling rig (pictured above, coded HD-981) that the state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) placed on May 2, 2014 in disputed waters south of the Paracel Islands, the tension began to rise as Vietnam officially objected to the placement – declaring that the rig is located within its continental shelf, and thus is an illegal territorial intrusion.</p>
                  <p>China, on the other hand, disregarded its southern neighbor’s objection by sending an approximate total of 80 ships to guard its rig, including seven military vessels, along with highly equipped aircrafts. In response to this movement, Hanoi dispatched 29 ships in an attempt to disrupt the rig’s placement and operations, leading to the current stand-off and ongoing tension between these two of the most prominent Communist countries in the world.</p>
                  <p>Drama most likely commenced to kick in and boosted rapidly when Vietnam accused Chinese vessels of turning high powered water cannons on Vietnamese ships, which ultimately rammed several of its vessels – causing both minor and major injuries to both ships and people.</p>

                  <h2>A Global Issue</h2>
                  <p>Implications of these developments are undoubtedly significant. As the rig has been placed immediately after President Obama’s visit to four Asian countries in late April, it can be deduced as an attempt by Beijing to test, and challenge, the resolve of Vietnam, ASEAN, and Washington. With the US seemingly distracted by other global occurrences that took place during this period, China clearly saw this as an opportunity to undertake actions that could ensure favorable long term regional and global consequences.</p>
                  <p>The deployment of HD-981, which Beijing insists will not be removed until August 15, has undoubtedly bolstered China-Vietnam tensions to a new level. While Hanoi is considerably determined to disrupt the rig’s operations, and Beijing refusing to step back any time soon, it is likely that any small acts of brinksmanship could develop into a realistic military confrontation.</p>

                  <h2>A Spicy Recipe For Patriotism</h2>
                  <p>While the tension at sea is still left to a stand-off, the situation in Vietnam found its way to heat up as the anti-China sentiment began to emerge. Taking off in Ho Chi Minh City during mid-May, demonstrations rapidly expanded and peaked with riots taking place around Chinese-owned factories and plants in the Ho Chi Minh City suburb areas.</p>
                  <img src="images/VIETNAMimages/VIETNAMpic.jpg" alt="">
                  <p class="italic">Anti-China sentiment is widespread across Vietnam, and its growth isn't showing signs of slowing down any time soon. (Photo from <a href="http://www.ap.org/">Associated Press</a>)</p>
                  <p>While physical damages to such establishments are allegedly high, the death of four Chinese workers due to the incident has caused concerns for Chinese residents in Vietnam. Certain Chinese expatriates and business owners subsequently have opted to terminate their operations within the country. Likewise, other Asian - but non-Chinese - firms who were affected by the riots (i.e. Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, South Korea) have similarly voiced worries about the future of their investment into the Vietnamese market.</p>

                  <h2>Business In Vietnam: A Dilemma For Investors</h2> 
                  <p>Unquestionably, the Vietnam-China tension has changed the dynamic of the business environment in this South East Asian country. As such is a point worthy of consideration, given the potential that Vietnam possesses as a developing economy. For the past decade, and especially within the past few years, Vietnam has continuously been recognized as a truly prospective target market for foreign investors. With rising prices and costs in China, as well as political instability in perceptively hot markets like Thailand, investors have been forwarding a big level of attention to other South East Asian alternatives like Vietnam and Indonesia.</p>
                  <p>Now with the possibility of a future military conflict ahead, it is natural for those who are involved in various businesses within the region to feel weary of future prospects. Albeit the atmosphere did cool down, thanks to governmental efforts, the sense of political and economic uncertainty means that it will perhaps be difficult for foreign businesses to know exactly what should be the next ideal step. If they opt to push forward with their operations, the outcome of a war will bring about great damages, but if they decide to step out, the opportunity cost will be likely large.</p> 
                  <blockquote>The riots confirm that if this sense of nationalism gets out of control, it could present an alarming risk not only to the business environment, but also to domestic political stability. As such is not an ideal place for investors to pour their money in.</blockquote>

                  <h2>Business As Usual...With The Right Action</h2>
                  <p>Putting these occurrences into perspective, it is clear that the role of the Vietnamese government will be crucial. While Chinese-owned businesses have shown signs of foregoing opportunities in Vietnam – a motive which is highly understandable, given the current anti-China sentiment -- and governmental officials have been less encouraged to hold them back, Western and/or non-Chinese businesses are receiving a tremendous amount of support and reassurance from the state. In a case in point example, local governments have recently promised to fully compensate any physical damages that might have been caused to Singaporean factories and plants by the riots.</p>
                  <img src="images/VIETNAMimages/VIETNAMpic2.jpg" alt="">
                  <p class="italic">Will the presence of US Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker in Vietnam help to calm investors over the country's economic prospects? (Photo from <a href="http://www.ap.org/">Associated Press</a>)</p>
                  <p>Similarly, US Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker have stated during a recent press conference in Hanoi that the oil rig will not affect the long-term commitment of US businesses in Vietnam. As part of her tour through three ASEAN countries as leader of a delegation of US CEOs and the US-ASEAN Business Council, Pritzker passed by Vietnam during a one-day visit and guaranteed that the US is keen on boosting ties with Vietnam in all fields, including economic, commercial, and investment relations. Following talks over the US commitment to support Vietnam in its current conflict with China, the presence of Pritzker in Vietnam during this period illustrates a great effort taken by both governments to maintain investors’ confidence within the region.</p>
                  <p>Albeit it could be too early to produce a conclusive statement, these initiatives are expected to effectively maintain the attractive status of Vietnam as an emerging market.</p>

                  <h2>Time To Reevaluate Your Investment Choices</h2>
                  <p>For global investors who are looking to Vietnam as the new hot destination, perhaps it would be a good time to reconsider putting their money into Chinese imports. As Chinese importers have seen a significant surge in the level of consumption and demand in the South East Asian market – following instances of anti-Chinese-imports boycotts taking place throughout the region – it will likely take some time before ASEAN consumers as a whole, and specifically Vietnamese as a specific case, find more trust in China.</p>
                  <p>Chinese-owned businesses, and to a certain extent businesses owned by nationals that carry an ethnic tie to China (i.e. Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong) will certainly be partially affected by the anti-China sentiment, although the fact that the majority of these businesses operate within the BSB service sector means that they will not take as big a toll as importers of consumer goods would. Like US and Western firms, non-Chinese-owned companies in general should be able to continue their business-as-usual operations with the government’s support behind their back.</p>
                  <p>In fact, an opportunity may even arise for non-Chinese firms as the number of clients choosing to neglect Chinese goods and services rapidly increases. Whatever the case may be, the government’s motives will be important, and it will be revealed, hopefully, in the near future.</p>
