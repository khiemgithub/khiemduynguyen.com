                  <p class="italic">Larry Ellison speaking about the company's critical focus on Security (as part of its strategic investment into the cloud) at Oracle OpenWorld 2019 - Oracle's annual tech conference</p>
                  <h2>Security means business</h2>
                  <p>Keeping Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) secure is a task of paramount importance that holds a central role in OCI's customer experience strategy. Ever since the conception of OCI, Larry Ellison has repeatedly pointed to Security as one of its top focus areas. In fact, OCI's homegrown second-generation cloud infrastructure was built on top of a "fundamental re-architecture of the conventional public cloud". As Larry himself stated simply during his keynote at Oracle OpenWorld 2019:</p> 
                  <blockquote>"The current state of the art of cloud defenses is just not good enough, not even close."</blockquote>
                  <p>As such, how well can OCI secure its cloud is a factor that possesses a direct business impact on how likely it is for the company to win its cloud market share.</p>
                  <h2>Aligning with business objectives</h2>
                  <p>As an organization, possessing a robust security posture would provide OCI with the foundation that enables customers to trust it with their most valuable workloads. In this respect, the company's ability to provide leading security requires that it strives to address the following business goals:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><span style="color:#4c4c4c;font-weight:bold">Regulatory Adherence &amp; Accreditation - </span>Keep OCI out of legal complications and win more business.</li>
                    <li><span style="color:#4c4c4c;font-weight:bold">OCI Security Bar - </span>Do the things necessary to secure our cloud.</li>
                    <li><span style="color:#4c4c4c;font-weight:bold">Rapid Security Response - </span>Fix all the bad things we find as efficiently as possible.</li>
                    <li><span style="color:#4c4c4c;font-weight:bold">Scalable Security Operations - </span>Keep up with 1, 2, and 3 as OCI continues grow.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>This all starts with knowing what the company must protect. OCI cannot secure what it doesn't know exist. <span style="color:#4c4c4c;font-weight:bold">In fact, the top threat to the security of OCI is a lack of an authoritative asset inventory and security reporting/assessment mechanism.</span></p> 
                  <h2>Introduction to Security Central</h2>
                  <p>Inventory management is at the core of OCI's security solution. The company needs an internal application that can help it capture rapidly changing asset information, and serve as the source of truth for all physical and virtual assets in OCI's data centers. At the same time, this application should also be a security reporting / assessment service that could provide a centralized view of the security status for all tracked assets. Ideally, it would enable OCI service owners, leadership, as well as Security and Compliance teams to understand the company's current security posture. It would automate security reporting for use in compliance audits, and notify asset owners when remediation is required. While Spotlight - OCI's legacy tool for inventory management - served as an effective inventory manager, it didn't quite do a good job at visualizing the desired centralized view of the organization's security posture.</p>
                  <p>As such, Security Central has been envisioned to become OCI's go-to security management service, with the ultimate goal of becoming a "single-pane" interface for OCI service teams, leadership, and Security / Compliance teams to assess and understand OCI's assets' security / compliance status. In a nutshell, OCI service teams should be efficiently notified of security findings and accordingly provided with a clear path to remediation; leadership can quickly understand the security status of assets owned by their teams and services, aggregated at any level; and Security / Compliance relies on Security Central's daily findings reports to understand the risk to OCI's compliance posture, giving them the ability to effectively generate reports for our auditors.</p>
                  <p>In order to help bring these ideals to life, the Security Central UI/UX requires enhancements that span across various themes / areas, and a truly collaborative effort that leverages an iterative design process:</p>
                  <img src="images/OCISECURITYimages/ocisecurityprocess.png" alt="">
                  &nbsp;  
                  <h2>Problem Statements &amp; User Personas</h2>
                  <p>Below is a general outline of the different themes that are relevant and all play a role in determining how good OCI's security posture could be. <span style="color:#4c4c4c;font-weight:bold">Through an affinity diagramming exercise, these themes have been defined based on the user data collected from user requirements meetings and user interviews.</span> Each of these themes presents certain challenges and user pain points - those of which will benefit from UI/UX enhancements as well as feature additions to the tool:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Overall Security Posture &amp; Security Operations Management</li>
                    <li>Vulnerability Findings Remediation / Patching Completeness</li>
                    <li>Security Bar Performance Assessment</li>
                  </ul>
                  <img src="images/OCISECURITYimages/ocisecurityaffinity.jpg" alt="">
                  <p class="italic">Affinity diagramming helps in identifying the top-level themes, thereby enhancing the design and product team's understanding of the problem space.</p>
                  <h1>Overall Security Posture &amp; Security Operations Management</h1>
                  <ul>
                    <li>It is difficult for OCI service teams and their leaders today to quickly and seamlessly gain a data-driven / high-level insight into their team's / org's security posture, thereby enhancing the challenge of allocating resources effectively to areas that need overall security support.</li>
                    <li>Likewise, OCI Security support teams lack a truly data-driven, seamless, and automated mechanism that will allow them to generate meaningful insights and metrics around their partner OCI service teams' security postures, thereby enhancing the challenge of efficiently supporting these teams in remediating their vulnerability findings. The existing support mechanism is very manual and heavily reliant on JIRA.</li>
                    <li>It is also difficult for OCI service teams to grasp a high-level view of their asset inventory, and pinpoint areas / resources that are posing security issues. Again, this enhances the challenge of allocating resources effectively to areas that need overall security support.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h1>Vulnerability Findings Remediation / Patching Completeness</h1>
                  <ul>
                    <li>OCI service teams are not proactively patching their resources early enough in the patching cycle. They are mostly acting reactively to their patching tickets escalating to Sev2 status, or worse, violating the published internal Patching SLA. The average percentage of patching tickets escalating to Sev2 status and risking violation of the published internal Patching SLA is high at over 10%. This poses the risk of OCI not meeting security compliance at a worryingly level, potentially placing a big business impact on the company.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h1>Security Bar Performance Assessment</h1>
                  <ul>
                    <li>It is difficult for OCI service teams and general OCI senior leadership to assess how well their org / team is doing in meeting the OCI Security Bar requirements, thereby enhancing the challenge of allocating resources effectively to areas that need overall security support. Security Bar is an interesting theme, because in a way it's a program that has been designed to cover aspects of both the two themes described above (i.e. patching completeness rate over a specific time interval is part of the Security Bar). However, it is necessary to give Security Bar its own theme as a way of emphasizing its significance - having been been repeatedly mentioned by users throughout our user interviews and requirements gathering sessions.</li>
                  </ul> 
                  <h1>User Personas</h1>
                  <p>Analyzing through these themes and user problems also lead to the identification of these primary user personas:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>OCI Service Engineer</li>
                    <li>OCI Service Manager</li>
                    <li>OCI Senior Leadership (VP-level)</li>
                    <li>OCI Security Team(s)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2>Design Goals</h2>
                  <p>To help better direct and keep the UX direction focused, a set of design goals and corresponding success metric(s) have been crafted for each defined theme:</p>
                  <img src="images/OCISECURITYimages/ocisecuritydesigngoals.png" alt="">
                  &nbsp;
                  <h2>User Goals &amp; Questions</h2>
                  <p>One finding gathered from the user research process is that while all users possess the same two birds-view questions, to various degrees, they may come to Security Central with differing goals, needs, and more granular questions in mind.</p>
                  <h1>Two Birds-View Questions</h1>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Is OCI secure?</li>
                    <li>Is OCI security-compliant?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h1>Granular-Level User Questions</h1>
                  <p>Below the birds-level user questions above are more drilled down, granular questions users would ask as they advance through their workflows. <span style="color:#4c4c4c;font-weight:bold">Different questions are asked by different groups of users, and it's important to precisely identify these connections (i.e. which user would ask what question, and why?) in order to better assess where the design priorities should be.</span> These questions are all directed and lead by a specific goal users strive to achieve by executing these workflows. A big table is created to consolidate all of this data. Below is a sliced portion of it:</p>
                  <img src="images/OCISECURITYimages/ocisecurityusergoals.png" alt="">
                  &nbsp;  
                  <h2>Early Design</h2>
                  <p>Conducting user research is extremely critical in opening more doors to better understanding user contexts. Equipped with this knowledge gain, <span style="color:#4c4c4c;font-weight:bold">early design sketches are accordingly produced to visualize plausible user journeys / workflows and how different stages throughout these flows may be mapped to the defined user goals and questions:</span></p>
                  <img src="images/OCISECURITYimages/ocisecuritysketches.jpg" alt="">
                  &nbsp; 
                  <p>User journey mapping as an exercise creates opportunities for the design and product team to expand further on the user worflows and envision how different interfaces / views could be designed to support these workflows. The User Goals &amp; Questions table is revisited frequently during this stage to ensure that user needs are always taken into account, and as the creative process begins with more interfaces coming into the picture, an extra column is added to the table to delienate how specific views could be leveraged to support specific user goals / needs:</p>
                  <img src="images/OCISECURITYimages/ocisecurityviews.png" alt="">
                  &nbsp;
                  <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
                  <p>Part of understanding users and their context is understanding the ecosystem within which they operate, and part of understanding this ecosystem requires an analysis of various competing providers of the same product, service, or simply solutions to similar UX problems. <span style="color:#4c4c4c;font-weight:bold">Competitive analysis is therefore a crucial aspect of the process. Not only does serve as a source for creative inspiration, it also helps surface better understandings around what works and what doesn't, thereby revealing opportunities where unarticulated user needs may be addressed:</span></p>
                  <img src="images/OCISECURITYimages/ocisecuritycompetition.png" alt="">
                  <p class="italic">Being the top two giants in the cloud market, Azure and AWS unsurprisingly come around to the design table a lot.</p>
                  <p><span style="color:#4c4c4c;font-weight:bold">Heuristic evaluation</span> is a common exercise that often accompanies these competitive analyses:</p>
                  <img src="images/OCISECURITYimages/ocisecurityheuristic.png" alt="">
                  &nbsp;
                  <h2>User Testing</h2>
                  <p>To avoid designing in a vacuum and ensure that a highly collaborative process is followed, coordination and support across all relevant products / functional areas - as well as other relevant stakeholders - are involved. <span style="color:#4c4c4c;font-weight:bold">Amongst different stakeholder groups, users play the most critical role. They too are involved in the design process in the form of user testing:</span></p>
                  <img src="images/OCISECURITYimages/ocisecuritytest.png" alt="">
                  &nbsp;
                  <p>In this respect, the design and product team behind Security Central holds a four-hours user testing session every sprint (two weeks). The sessions are mandatory for designers and engineers, while all other product stakeholders are encouraged to attend. For each session, typically two design questions / areas with clearly defined test goals are picked for testing, and four user participants are selected to test each item. Each test is conducted and timed within a twenty minutes box, and users are asked to finish a given task using the provided UI during this time box.</p>
                  <p>Depending on the participants' time and physical availabilities, either an in-person or remote test is held. Throughout the tests, participants are encouraged to speak aloud their thoughts, experiences, questions, and/or pain points, and all of their quotes are carefully noted down. Specific workflow metrics (i.e. time taken to complete tasks, task completiton rate) are also identified and tracked throughout the tests. All of these data are accordingly collected and further consolidated by the design and product team immediately following the test sessions.</p> 
                  <h1>A selected example of how user testing helps to reveal design gaps and influence design directions</h1>
                  &nbsp;
                  <p>1.<span style="color:#4c4c4c;font-weight:bold"> Upcoming Key Dates</span> - Since Security Central's inception, users have repeatedly expressed a desire to have a "timeline visualization". Essentially, they need an effective mechanism that can help provide better visibility into relevant security timelines (i.e. host patching) and the important dates / gates they should be aware of. Early design explorations made use of common time-related components such as the vertical time journey (top) or the calendar (bottom):</p>
                  <img src="images/OCISECURITYimages/ocisecuritytimelinebefore.png" alt="">
                  &nbsp;
                  <p>User testing, however, reveals that:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Users need a timeline view that spans across two consecutive months. Some cycles start on the 15th of every month and lasts for the entire thirty days.</li>
                    <li>Rather than just telling them of upcoming deadlines, users prefer the system to dynamically inform them whether they actually have to care about these deadlines (based on their custom environments). For example, if they have completed host patching for the current cycle, they wouldn't have to worry about any upcoming patching-related deadlines. Users need the system to communicate this message effectively.</li> 
                    <li>Security is critical by nature, and users need to be (subtly) given a sense of urgency when it comes to security matters. Informing them of upcoming deadlines is nice, but they need to better understand the implications / consequences of not hitting these due dates.</li>
                    <li>The "timeline visualization" is an opportunity where users can be guided towards solutions for a set of particular issues. They have a deadline coming up, they know they have stuff to work on, they are informed of the implications of not addressing them, but where do they start? Again, such messaging needs to be intelligently communicated to users.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>These learnings in turn present the design and product team with an opportunity to modify the "Upcoming Key Dates" card on the Summary Dashboard view in order to better serve user needs:</p>

                  <h2>High-Fidelity Design</h2>
                  <p>Below is a few selected hi-fidelity wireframes produced for various purposes, including leadership demos, user testing, and general design-dev collaborations. These are created using the existing UI components library utilized by the UI dev team, with close attention paid to maintaining visual consistency across the OCI services portfolio.</p>
                  <h1>Summary Dashboard - Before</h1>

                  <h1>Summary Dashboard - After</h1>
                  <p>Labelled are the important design decisions / directions made for the Summary Dashboard view:</p>

                  &nbsp;
                  <h2>Progress Tracking</h2>
                  <p>The original design goals and their corresponding success metric(s) are constantly tracked and monitored as one simple validation of the design directions taken. One year following numerous iterative UI/UX enhancements to Security Central, and the results have been quite encouraging:</p>
                  <img src="images/OCISECURITYimages/ocisecurityresult.png" alt="">
                  &nbsp;
                  <h2>Design / Product Opportunities</h2>
                  <p>Designing for Security Central is a super exciting project, as it presents endless opportunities where design and technology can join force to create a real impact for users and on the business. Throughout the design and development process, multiple areas have been identified as future design aspirations the team could take on to make Security Central an even more delightful application for users:</p>  
                  <p>1.<span style="color:#4c4c4c;font-weight:bold"> Dynamic forecasting and adjusting</span> - With OCI's strategic focus on autonomous security, powered by machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies, Security Central will have the ability to automatically identify issues, forecast needs, and automatically make holistic adjustments across the entire user fleet in order to maintain their security posture.</p>
                  <p>2.<span style="color:#4c4c4c;font-weight:bold"> Personal and human</span> - A relationship between OCI and users already exist, as they use its products and interact with its brand. Why not speak to them conversationally and present information in a way that feels personable and human. After all, companies build products so they may work for users - not the other way around. Security Central, as a product, strives to help users become more efficient in their jobs. Why not present information in a way that makes users perceive Security Central as if it's an extension of their team.</p>
                  <p>3.<span style="color:#4c4c4c;font-weight:bold"> Contextual content</span> - Users shouldn't have to dig into different areas of a product to obtain different documents and information they need to complete a task. As a product, Security Central should be able to intelligently display the relevant information in one place by seamlessly integrating information, documents, and functions into single, easy-to-consume views - wherever and whenever users may need them.</p>     
                   <p>4.<span style="color:#4c4c4c;font-weight:bold"> Going external</span> Security Central has proven its value with measurable benefits as an internal tool within OCI. And there shouldn't be any limitations to what it can do for external customers as well. With OCI offerings becoming increasingly diverse in breadth and depth, along with third-party integrations, customers will start caring deeply about the security posture of their own built environments and systems on top of the OCI infrastructure. Security Central, inevitably, will have the potential to become the one stop shop for all things security-lated consumable by external customers too.</p>     
                  <h2>Special Bonus: Introducing Redwood</h2>
                  <p>Oracle recently introduced its brand new user experience design language - Redwood - to the world at its 2019 OpenWorld conference. This marks an exciting beginning for the company and its brand, and is the fruit of one year worth of tireless creative exploration, execution, supported by collaborative efforts that span across various strategic organizational functional areas. With the launch of Redwood, Oracle's vision is to completely revamp its customer experience with its products and brand. In the words of an Oracle design executive:</p>
                  <blockquote>"Redwood is for our products user interfaces and for telling our story. It's for both our digital and our physical experiences. It's a new design system for Oracle."</blockquote>

                  <p id="ociconclusion">It truly is an exciting time to be a UX Designer at Oracle, and it certainly is a huge design opportunity for Security Central to elevate to an experience status that will not only be functional and reliable, but also usable and delightful in such a way that users will love and consistently emerge with a positive emotional outcome.</p>
